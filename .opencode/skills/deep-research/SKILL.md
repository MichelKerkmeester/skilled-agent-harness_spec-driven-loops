# Autonomous Deep Research Loop

Note: `Task` is allowed for the command executor that manages the loop. The `@deep-research` agent itself is LEAF-only and does not dispatch sub-agents.

Iterative research protocol with fresh context per iteration, externalized state, and convergence detection for deep technical investigation.

Runtime path resolution:
- OpenCode/Copilot runtime: `.opencode/agents/*.md`
- Claude runtime: `.claude/agents/*.md`
- Codex runtime: `.codex/agents/*.toml`
- Gemini runtime: `.gemini/agents/*.md`

Operator contract precedence for this skill surface:
- Command entrypoint syntax in `.opencode/commands/deep/start-research-loop.md`
- Convergence math in `references/convergence/convergence.md` and the deep-research YAML workflow
- Runtime agent inventories from the checked-in runtime directories above

### Convergence Threshold Semantics

**Default:** 0.05 on newInfoRatio (fully-new=1.0, partially-new=0.5, +0.10 simplicity bonus, capped 1.0)

**Semantic:** `convergenceThreshold` compares newly discovered information against accumulated research knowledge with negative-knowledge emphasis. Lower = more iterations / higher signal threshold.

**NOT INTERCHANGEABLE with siblings:**
- `deep-review` uses 0.10 default on weighted P0/P1/P2 severity ratio
- `deep-ai-council` uses 0.20 default on adjudicator-verdict stability

Carrying threshold expectations across siblings will cause unexpected iteration counts. See this skill's changelog and decision records for the cross-sibling threshold research and parity invariants that confirm thresholds do not carry across siblings.

## 1. WHEN TO USE

### Activation Triggers

Use this skill when:
- Deep investigation requiring multiple rounds of discovery
- Topic spans 3+ technical domains or sources
- Initial findings need progressive refinement
- Overnight or unattended research sessions
- Research where prior findings inform subsequent queries

Keyword triggers:

- `autoresearch`
- `deep research`
- `autonomous research`
- `research loop`
- `iterative research`
- `multi-round research`
- `deep investigation`
- `comprehensive research`

### Use Cases

Use deep-research for multi-round technical investigation, source triangulation, repeated exploration with fresh context, and research sessions where prior findings should shape the next focus.

### When NOT to Use

- Simple, single-question research (use direct codebase search or `/speckit:plan`)
- Known-solution documentation (use `/speckit:plan`)
- Implementation tasks (use `/speckit:implement`)
- Quick codebase searches (use `@context` or direct Grep/Glob)
- Fewer than 3 sources needed (single-pass research suffices)

---

## 2. SMART ROUTING

> Pattern: aligned with the [sk-doc smart-router resilience template](../sk-doc/assets/skill/skill_smart_router.md).

### Resource Domains

The router discovers markdown resources recursively from `references/` and `assets/`, then applies intent scoring from `RESOURCE_MAP`. Keep routing domain-focused rather than hardcoding exhaustive inventories.

- `references/guides/quick_reference.md` for the first-touch operator cheat sheet.
- `references/protocol/loop_protocol.md` for lifecycle, dispatch, reducer sequencing, and command-owned state flow.
- `references/protocol/spec_check_protocol.md` for bounded `spec.md` anchoring and generated-fence write-back.
- `references/convergence*.md` for stop contracts, signals, recovery, graph gates, and reference-only convergence ideas.
- `references/state*.md` for packet layout, JSONL records, markdown outputs, reducer ownership, and reconstruction.
- `references/guides/capability_matrix.md` for runtime parity.
- `assets/*.md` for markdown templates and prompt assets that are safe to route through guarded markdown loading.

### Resource Loading Levels

| Level | When to Load | Resources |
|-------|--------------|-----------|
| ALWAYS | Every skill invocation | Quick reference baseline |
| CONDITIONAL | If intent signals match | Loop, convergence, state, spec anchoring, runtime parity references |
| ON_DEMAND | Only on explicit request | Full reference set and markdown assets |

### Phase Signals

| Phase | Signal | Primary Resources |
|-------|--------|-------------------|
| Init | No JSONL exists or setup context | `loop_protocol.md`, `state_format.md`, `state_jsonl.md` |
| Iteration | Dispatch context includes iteration number | `loop_protocol.md`, `state_outputs.md`, `convergence_signals.md` |
| Stuck | Dispatch context includes recovery language | `convergence_recovery.md`, `state_reducer_registry.md` |
| Synthesis | STOP candidate or final report | `convergence.md`, `state_outputs.md`, `spec_check_protocol.md` |

### Smart Router Pseudocode

The authoritative routing logic for scoped loading, weighted intent scoring, ambiguity handling, and graceful fallback.

- Pattern 1: Runtime Discovery - `discover_markdown_resources()` recursively scans `references/` and `assets/`.
- Pattern 2: Existence-Check Before Load - `load_if_available()` guards paths, checks `inventory`, and suppresses repeats with `seen`.
- Pattern 3: Extensible Routing Key - intent labels route to loop resource families without static file inventories.
- Pattern 4: Multi-Tier Graceful Fallback - `UNKNOWN_FALLBACK_CHECKLIST` requests disambiguation and missing families return a helpful notice.

## 3. HOW IT WORKS

### Invocation Contract

This skill is invoked exclusively through `/deep:start-research-loop:auto` or `/deep:start-research-loop:confirm`. The command YAML owns state, dispatch, convergence, and synthesis.

Never simulate the loop with ad hoc shell dispatch, nested CLI loops, direct `@deep-research` Task dispatch, `/tmp` prompt files, or state outside the resolved local research packet.

### Executor Selection Contract

The YAML workflow owns executor selection. Native `@deep-research` is the default path; CLI executors are routed through the workflow, not through ad hoc shell loops.

Cross-CLI delegation is possible inside each executor sandbox but discouraged. Do not invoke the same CLI from within itself, and do not assume auth from a parent executor propagates to child CLIs.

Executor invariants:

1. Produce a non-empty iteration markdown file at `{state_paths.iteration_pattern}`.
2. Append a JSONL delta record to `{state_paths.state_log}` with required fields: `type`, `iteration`, `newInfoRatio`, `status`, and `focus`.
3. Respect the LEAF-agent constraint: no sub-dispatch, no nested loops, and max 12 tool calls per iteration.

Failure modes include `iteration_file_missing`, `iteration_file_empty`, `jsonl_not_appended`, `jsonl_missing_fields`, and `jsonl_parse_error`. Three consecutive failures route to stuck recovery.

### Lifecycle Contract

Runtime-supported lifecycle modes:

| Mode | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `new` | First run against the spec folder |
| `resume` | Continue the active lineage and append a typed `resumed` JSONL event |
| `restart` | Archive the existing research tree, mint a fresh `sessionId`, increment `generation`, and append a typed `restarted` event |

Deferred modes are `fork` and `completed-continue`. They are reserved but not runtime-supported.

### Code-Graph Readiness TrustState Surface

The live code-graph readiness contract reaches four TrustState values: `live`, `stale`, `absent`, and `unavailable`.

`cached`, `imported`, `rebuilt`, and `rehomed` remain declared in the shared TrustState type for compatibility, but the readiness helpers used here do not emit them today.

### Resource Map Integration

When `{spec_folder}/resource-map.md` exists at init, deep research promotes it from ad hoc context to canonical packet state.

- Persist `resource_map_present: true` in `deep-research-config.json`.
- Read the map once during init and summarize it into `deep-research-strategy.md` `Known Context`.
- The snapshot MUST include per-section entry counts across `READMEs`, `Documents`, `Commands`, `Agents`, `Skills`, `Specs`, `Scripts`, `Tests`, `Config`, and `Meta`.
- The snapshot MUST also include a one-line theme summary for each resource-map section so later iterations inherit the map's structure without rereading the entire file.
- Per-iteration prompts surface `resource-map.md` as the exclusion set for previously inventoried files.
- Treat files already listed on the map as known inventory, not as net-new discoveries.
- Only flag files as gaps when they look relevant to the active investigation and are missing from the map.
- Final synthesis cites `{spec_folder}/resource-map.md` in `research.md` References when the map was present at init.
- Convergence also emits `{artifact_dir}/resource-map.md` from research delta evidence unless the operator passes `--no-resource-map`.

When `{spec_folder}/resource-map.md` is absent at init:

- Persist `resource_map_present: false`.
- Write `resource-map.md not present; skipping coverage gate` into `Known Context`.
- Omit the exclusion-set hint from iteration guidance.
- Continue the loop normally; absence is informational, not a failure.

### Architecture: 3-Layer Integration

`/deep:start-research-loop` owns the YAML workflow, which initializes state, dispatches one LEAF iteration at a time, evaluates convergence, synthesizes `research/research.md`, and saves continuity. The `@deep-research` agent executes only one research cycle per dispatch.

### State Packet Location

The research state packet always lives under the target spec's local `research/` folder. Root-spec targets use `{spec_folder}/research/` directly. Child-phase and sub-phase targets use **flat-first**: a first run with an empty `research/` directory writes flat at `{spec_folder}/research/`. A `pt-NN` subfolder (`{basename(spec_folder)}-pt-{NN}`) is allocated only when prior content already exists in `research/` for a non-matching target (continuation runs reuse the existing flat artifact or matching `pt-NN` packet). This avoids the unnecessary `pt-01` wrapper on first runs.

Example (first run on a child phase): `.../026-graph.../019-system-hardening/001-initial-research/004-desc-regen/` writes to `004-desc-regen/research/` directly.

Example (subsequent run with prior content for a different target): `004-desc-regen/research/004-desc-regen-pt-02/` (pt-NN allocated as a sibling to the prior content).

State files include `deep-research-config.json`, `deep-research-state.jsonl`, `deep-research-strategy.md`, `deep-research-findings-registry.json`, `deep-research-dashboard.md`, `.deep-research-pause`, `.deep-research.lock`, `resource-map.md`, `research.md`, and `iterations/iteration-NNN.md`.

v(next): `deep-research-findings-registry.json` is the canonical registry name for sibling-skill consistency.

### Core Innovation: Fresh Context Per Iteration

Each agent dispatch gets a fresh context window. State continuity comes from files, not memory. This solves context degradation in long research sessions.

Adapted from: karpathy/autoresearch (loop concept), AGR (fresh context "Ralph Loop"), pi-autoresearch (JSONL state), autoresearch-opencode (context injection).

### Data Flow

Init creates config, strategy, and state logs. Each loop reads state, checks convergence, dispatches `@deep-research`, writes iteration markdown and JSONL deltas, refreshes reducer-owned state, and either continues or synthesizes and saves continuity.

Late-INIT can also anchor the research run to `spec.md`: the workflow acquires the advisory lock, classifies `folder_state`, seeds or appends bounded context before LOOP, and then syncs one generated findings block back into `spec.md` during SYNTHESIS while keeping `research/research.md` canonical.

That contract is exact:
- `folder_state` is always one of `no-spec`, `spec-present`, `spec-just-created-by-this-run`, or `conflict-detected`
- the advisory lock lives at `research/.deep-research.lock` from late INIT through save, skip-save, or cancel cleanup
- post-synthesis write-back replaces exactly one `<!-- BEGIN GENERATED: deep-research/spec-findings -->` ... `<!-- END GENERATED: deep-research/spec-findings -->` fence under the chosen host anchor
- the full bounded mutation rules live in [spec_check_protocol.md](references/protocol/spec_check_protocol.md)

### Key Concepts

Research continuity is externalized to files, each iteration starts fresh, convergence uses newInfoRatio/stuck/question signals, strategy and registry are reducer-owned, JSONL remains append-only, and final synthesis consolidates `research/research.md`.

---

## 4. RULES

### ALWAYS

1. **Read state first** -- Agent must read JSONL and strategy.md before any research action
2. **One focus per iteration** -- Pick ONE research sub-topic from strategy.md "Next Focus"
3. **Externalize findings** -- Write to iteration-NNN.md, not held in agent context
4. **Update strategy** -- Append to "What Worked"/"What Failed", update "Next Focus"
5. **Report newInfoRatio** -- Every iteration JSONL record must include newInfoRatio
6. **Respect exhausted approaches** -- Never retry approaches in the "Exhausted" list
7. **Cite sources** -- Every finding must cite `[SOURCE: url]` or `[SOURCE: file:line]`
8. **Use generate-context.js for memory saves** -- Never manually create memory files
9. **Treat research/research.md as workflow-owned** -- Iteration findings feed synthesis; the workflow owns the canonical `research/research.md`
10. **Document ruled-out directions per iteration** -- Every iteration must include what was tried and failed
11. **Report newInfoRatio + 1-sentence novelty justification** -- Every JSONL iteration record must include both
12. **Quality guards must pass before convergence** -- Source diversity, focus alignment, and no single-weak-source checks must pass before STOP can trigger
13. **Respect reducer ownership** -- The workflow reducer, not the agent, is the source of truth for strategy machine-owned sections, dashboard metrics, and findings registry updates
14. **Use canonical packet names only** -- Write `deep-research-*` artifacts and `research/.deep-research-pause`; legacy names are read-only migration aliases
15. **Invoke through the command workflow** -- Use `/deep:start-research-loop:auto` or `/deep:start-research-loop:confirm`, and let the YAML workflow own dispatch

### NEVER

1. **Dispatch sub-agents** -- @deep-research is LEAF-only (NDP compliance)
2. **Hold findings in context** -- Write everything to files
3. **Exceed TCB** -- Target 8-11 tool calls per iteration (max 12)
4. **Ask the user** -- Autonomous execution; make best-judgment decisions
5. **Skip convergence checks** -- Every iteration must be evaluated
6. **Modify config after init** -- Config is read-only after initialization
7. **Overwrite prior findings** -- Append to research/research.md, never replace
8. **Implement fixes during research** -- Report findings only; implementation is a separate follow-up step.
9. **Simulate loop dispatch** -- Do not write custom shell loops, nested CLI loops, `/tmp` prompt dispatchers, or direct Task loops for `@deep-research`

### Iteration Status Enum

`complete | timeout | error | stuck | insight | thought`

- `insight`: Low newInfoRatio but important conceptual breakthrough
- `thought`: Analytical-only iteration, no evidence gathering

### EXPERIMENTAL / REFERENCE-ONLY FEATURES

These concepts remain documented for future design work, but they are not part of the live executable contract for `/deep:start-research-loop`:
1. **Wave orchestration** -- parallel question fan-out, pruning, and breakthrough logic
2. **Checkpoint commits** -- per-iteration git commits
3. **Wave orchestration on the same lineage** -- parallel fan-out remains reference-only
4. **Alternate CLI dispatch** -- process-isolated `claude -p` or similar dispatch modes

### ESCALATE IF

1. **3+ consecutive timeouts** -- Infrastructure issue, not research problem
2. **State file corruption unrecoverable** -- Cannot reconstruct from JSONL or iteration files
3. **All approaches exhausted with questions remaining** -- Research may need human guidance
4. **Security concern in findings** -- Proprietary code or credentials discovered
5. **All recovery tiers exhausted** -- No automatic recovery path remaining

Core documentation: `references/guides/quick_reference.md`, `references/protocol/loop_protocol.md`, `references/protocol/spec_check_protocol.md`, `references/convergence/convergence.md`, and `references/state/state_format.md`.

Focused convergence references: `references/convergence/convergence_signals.md`, `references/convergence/convergence_recovery.md`, `references/convergence/convergence_graph.md`, and `references/convergence/convergence_reference_only.md`.

Focused state references: `references/state/state_jsonl.md`, `references/state/state_outputs.md`, and `references/state/state_reducer_registry.md`.

Templates: `assets/deep_research_config.json`, `assets/deep_research_strategy.md`, `assets/deep_research_dashboard.md`, `assets/prompt_pack_iteration.md.tmpl`, and `assets/runtime_capabilities.json`.

Cross-skill alignment: `deep-research` owns iterative investigation. Its shared resource family mirrors `deep-review` and `deep-ai-council`, but its vocabulary remains novelty, sources, negative knowledge, question coverage, and research synthesis rather than severity findings or council agreement.

---

## 6. SUCCESS CRITERIA

### Loop Completion
- Research loop ran to convergence or max iterations
- All state files present and consistent (config, JSONL, strategy)
- research/resource-map.md produced from converged deltas unless `config.resource_map.emit == false` (operator flag: `--no-resource-map`)
- research/research.md produced with findings from all iterations
- Canonical continuity surfaces updated via generate-context.js

### Quality Gates

Blocking gates: valid config/strategy/state before loop, iteration markdown plus JSONL plus reducer refresh per iteration, final `research/research.md` and convergence report after loop, and quality guards for source diversity/focus/no weak single source. Continuity save is expected but non-blocking.

### Convergence Report

Every completed loop produces a convergence report:
- Stop reason (converged, max_iterations, all_questions_answered, stuck_unrecoverable)
- Total iterations completed
- Questions answered ratio
- Average newInfoRatio trend

---

## 7. INTEGRATION POINTS

### Framework Integration

This skill operates within the behavioral framework defined in the active runtime's root doc (CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, CODEX.md, or GEMINI.md).

Key integrations:
- **Gate 2**: Skill routing via `skill_advisor.py` (keywords: autoresearch, deep research)
- **Gate 3**: File modifications require spec folder question per the root doc Gate 3
- **Continuity**: `/speckit:resume` is the operator-facing recovery surface; canonical packet continuity is written via `generate-context.js`
- **Orchestrator**: @orchestrate dispatches @deep-research as LEAF agent

### Continuity Integration

Before research, recover context with `/speckit:resume` using `handover.md -> _memory.continuity -> spec docs`. During each iteration, write `iterations/iteration-NNN.md`, append JSONL, and let the reducer refresh strategy/registry/dashboard. After research, save continuity through `generate-context.js`.

### Command Integration

| Command | Relationship |
|---------|-------------|
| `/deep:start-research-loop` | Primary invocation point |
| `/speckit:resume` | Canonical recovery surface before resuming or extending an active packet |
| `/speckit:plan` | Next step after deep research completes |
| `/memory:save` | Manual memory save (deep research auto-saves) |
