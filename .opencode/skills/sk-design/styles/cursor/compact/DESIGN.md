# Cursor — Style Reference
> Warm parchment atelier lit by embers

**Theme:** light

Cursor uses a warm parchment editorial language: cream canvas, ink-black text, and a single ember-orange accent that activates links and emphasis rather than filling buttons. Headlines whisper at weight 400 in CursorGothic with progressively tighter tracking as size grows — authority comes from restraint and letter-tightening, never from bold weight. Surfaces stay flat and paper-like with hairline borders and soft warm-gray shadows; corners stay sharp at 4px throughout. EB Garamond appears selectively for editorial subheadings and prose, and berkeleyMono handles code, labels, and metadata, giving the system a typographic personality that feels closer to a literary journal than a SaaS dashboard.

## Colors

| Name | Value | Role |
|------|-------|------|
| Parchment | `#f7f7f4` | Page background, primary canvas — warm cream that softens contrast and makes ink feel printed rather than digital |
| Bone | `#f2f1ed` | Card surfaces and elevated containers — one step darker than canvas, creates paper-on-paper layering without borders |
| Linen | `#e6e5e0` | Light neutral action fill for buttons on dark surfaces. |
| Stone | `#cdcdc9` | Hairline borders, dividers, subtle separators — warm-tinted 1px rules |
| Mist | `#a1a19f` | Tertiary helper text, captions — between muted and secondary |
| Driftwood | `#84847e` | Secondary body text, table content — quieter than primary ink |
| Ash | `#7a7974` | Icon fills, tertiary body text, subdued UI labels — the workhorse muted tone |
| Ink | `#26251e` | Primary text, primary action button background, nav text — warm-tinted near-black, never pure #000 |
| Ember | `#f54e00` | Orange text accent for links, tags, and emphasized short phrases. Do not promote it to the primary CTA color |
| Amber | `#c08532` | Warm action button fill (Build, Continue) and accent icon strokes — earthy companion to ember, used in product UI chrome |
| Forest | `#34785c` | Green action color for filled buttons, selected navigation states, and focused conversion moments. Use as a supporting accent, not as a status color |
| Verdant | `#1f8a65` | Green text accent for links, tags, and emphasized short phrases. Use as a supporting accent, not as a status color |
| Crimson | `#cf2d56` | Red text accent for links, tags, and emphasized short phrases. Use as a supporting accent, not as a status color |

## Components

### Primary Filled Button (Download)
**Role:** Hero CTA, top-bar Download

Background #26251 (Ink), text #f7f7f4 (Parchment), 4px radius, padding 0.78em 1.35em 0.8em, CursorGothic 14px weight 400. This is the highest-contrast action on the page — the dark pill against cream canvas. No gradient, no border. Transition: color/background 150ms cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1).

### Secondary Filled Button
**Role:** Secondary CTA (Request a demo, Continue)

Background #e6e5e0 (Linen), text #26251 (Ink), 4px radius, padding 0.78em 1.35em 0.8em, CursorGothic 14px weight 400. Arrow glyph (→) in same color as label. Lighter visual weight than primary; pairs next to it in the hero.

### Ghost Text Button
**Role:** Inline actions, nav items, skip links

Background transparent, text #26251 with 60% opacity, no border, no padding (or 6px square padding for icon variants), 4px radius. Underline on hover. CursorGothic 13–14px weight 400.

### Amber Action Button
**Role:** In-product action (Build, Continue)

Background #c08532 (Amber), text light cream, 4px radius. Used inside macOS window mockups and CLI/agent UI where warm chromatic punctuation is needed. Compact padding 6px 12px.

### Forest Action Button
**Role:** Success / PR actions (View PR)

Background #34785c (Forest), text #f7f7f4, 1px border in same green, 4px radius. Solid filled variant for review/merge confirmations in product mockups.

### Default Product Card
**Role:** Container for screenshots, feature blocks, logo strip

Background #f2f1ed (Bone), 4px radius, 1px border color-mix(in oklab, #26251 5%, transparent), soft elevation: 28px 70px / 14px 32px double-layer warm shadow. Padding 24px internal. No drop shadow on flat list variants.

### Logo Trust Tile
**Role:** Customer logos in social-proof row

Background #e6e5e0 (Linen), fully rounded (pill shape via flex/aspect-square), 4px visual feel, logo rendered in #26251 at 60% opacity. 16px internal padding. Arranged in a single horizontal row at section width.

### Window Mockup Frame
**Role:** macOS product screenshot container

Outer card at #f2f1ed with 4px radius and hairline border + soft elevation. Inner window chrome: three traffic-light dots (gray), centered title in 13px system-ui, tab strip with active state underline. File tabs use berkeleyMono 12px. No hard drop shadow on the window itself — the surrounding card provides elevation.

### Navigation Bar
**Role:** Top site header

Transparent background, 52px height, 24px horizontal padding, logo + wordmark left at 14px weight 500 CursorGothic, nav links center at 14px CursorGothic weight 400, right cluster: text Sign in, ghost Contact sales, filled Download pill. No sticky shadow.

### Terminal Input Field
**Role:** CLI command bar, curl/install snippets

Background transparent or #f2f1ed, 1px solid border in color-mix(#26251 10%, transparent), 4px radius, 10px 12px padding, text in berkeleyMono 12px, caret in #26251e. Prompt character ($ or >) in #7a7974.

### Footer Link Column
**Role:** Footer sitemap groups

Column heading in CursorGothic 14px weight 500 #26251, link list below in 13px weight 400 #7a7974, 8px row gap. No background card — sits directly on canvas.

### Mono Metadata Tag
**Role:** Status labels, file names, model names

Background transparent, text in berkeleyMono 12px #7a7974, no border, no radius. Used inline with body text to mark file types, timestamps, and developer metadata.

### Selection Highlight
**Role:** Text selection

Background #8BC4F8 — the only cool tone in the system, reserved exclusively for browser text selection to avoid competing with the warm palette.

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do
- Use 4px border-radius on every button, card, input, and tile — 4px appears 137× in the data and defines the sharp-but-not-angular feel
- Set all headlines at weight 400 in CursorGothic; never use 600+ for display sizes — the whisper-weight with tight tracking IS the signature
- Apply progressively tighter letter-spacing as type grows: 0.01em at 14px → -0.005em at 22px → -0.012em at 26px → -0.02em at 36px → -0.03em at 72px
- Use #f7f7f4 Parchment as canvas and #f2f1ed Bone as card surface; layer with 1px borders in color-mix(#26251 5–10%, transparent) before reaching for shadows
- Use #f54e00 Ember only on inline text links and emphasis — never as a button background, large surface, or icon fill
- Reach for EB Garamond serif on editorial subheadings and prose blocks; keep it away from UI labels and navigation
- Use berkeleyMono 12px for all code, file paths, CLI commands, and developer-facing metadata
- Pair the dark filled button (#26251 on #f7f7f4) with a light secondary (#e6e5e0) in the same action group — never stack two filled buttons of the same weight

### Don't
- Do not use pure white (#ffffff) or pure black (#000000) — the system is built on warm cream and warm ink; pure neutrals break the parchment feel
- Do not apply weight 600 or 700 to headings — the signature is weight 400 headlines; bold kills the editorial restraint
- Do not use pill shapes (radius ≥ 999px) on buttons or cards — 4px is the workhorse; pill rounding breaks the paper-cut geometry
- Do not introduce gradients, glows, or color washes — the system is flat and editorial; depth comes only from hairline borders and soft warm-gray shadows
- Do not tint shadows blue or cool — shadows must stay warm rgba(0,0,0,0.14) over cream to feel like paper, not glass
- Do not apply the Ember orange (#f54e00) to backgrounds or large fills — it is text-only punctuation, not a surface color
- Do not use the system-ui font for headings or prominent text — reserve it for micro labels where custom fonts add noise
- Do not stack more than two button styles in a single action group — one filled dark + one filled light, or one filled + one ghost, never three filled

## Elevation

- **Product mockup card:** `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.14) 0px 28px 70px 0px, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1) 0px 14px 32px 0px, oklab(0.263 -0.002 0.012 / 0.1) 0px 0px 0px 1px`
- **Flyout / popover:** `0 0 1rem #00000005, 0 0 0.5rem #00000002`
- **Window inset top border:** `0 -1px 0 0 var(--color-theme-border-02) inset`

## Surfaces

- **Canvas** (`#f7f7f4`) — Page background
- **Card** (`#f2f1ed`) — Default card surface, product mockup background
- **Elevated** (`#e6e5e0`) — Secondary buttons, logo tiles, higher-elevation cards
- **Outline** (`#cdcdc9`) — Hairline borders on elevated surfaces

## Imagery

Product screenshots dominate — large macOS window mockups showing the Cursor IDE in action: file tabs, diff views, agent plans, terminal panels, Slack/chat integrations. Each window mockup sits inside a #f2f1ed card frame with soft warm elevation. A muted landscape photograph (mountains/desert horizon) bleeds behind the hero section, adding warmth without competing with the UI. Customer logos (Stripe, OpenAI, Linear, Datadog, NVIDIA, Figma, Ramp, Adobe) appear as monochrome wordmarks inside pill-shaped Linen tiles. No people photography, no illustrations, no abstract decorative graphics — the product UI and brand wordmarks carry all visual weight. Icons throughout are thin-stroke monoline glyphs filled in #7a7974 Ash, never chromatic.

## Layout

Max-width 1300px centered, 24px outer padding. Top nav: 52px tall transparent header with logo + wordmark left, 4 nav links center, Sign in / Contact / Download right-aligned cluster. Hero: left-aligned headline + dual CTA stack with text descending from top-left, then a full-width product mockup card spanning below. Trust strip: single horizontal row of 8 logo tiles in a single line at section width. Feature sections alternate left-text + right-screenshot in two-column layout, each 50/50, with 64–96px vertical rhythm between sections. All feature screenshots are window mockups with identical macOS chrome. Footer: four-column link grid with brand mark left. Sections separated by generous breathing room rather than dividers — the cream canvas itself provides separation.

## Similar Brands

- **Linear** — Same monochrome cream-on-ink palette, 4px sharp corners, weight 400 whisper-headlines, and warm-gray shadows — Linear and Cursor share the editorial-paper aesthetic over flashy gradients
- **Vercel** — Light-theme monochrome base with a single chromatic accent color and compact 4px-based spacing; both treat the page canvas as warm off-white rather than pure white
- **Stripe** — Document-style typography hierarchy with tight tracking on display sizes, warm gradient-free surfaces, and small chromatic accents used sparingly for links and emphasis
- **Arc Browser** — Warm cream and soft-shadow product showcase cards with hairline borders, giving window mockups a paper-elevated feel rather than glass-elevated
- **Notion** — Restrained nearly-monochrome palette with one warm accent, compact density, and editorial serif touches appearing selectively against a geometric sans-serif body
