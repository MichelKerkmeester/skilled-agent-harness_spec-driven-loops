> **Note**: This is an official MCP server maintained by the Model Context Protocol organization.

### Key Features

- **Dynamic Thought Sequences**: Adjust the number of thoughts as needed during analysis
- **Branching Exploration**: Explore alternative approaches from any thought point
- **Revision Support**: Reconsider and revise previous thoughts when new insights emerge
- **Flexible Structure**: No predefined stages - adapt the thinking process to your problem
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor your position in the thought sequence
- **Zero Installation**: Runs via npx - no manual installation required

### How It Works

```
Start Thinking → Record Thought 1 → Record Thought 2 → ... → Final Conclusion
                      ↓                    ↓
                 [Revise if needed]   [Branch to explore alternatives]
```

The tool supports:
- **Linear progression**: Move through thoughts sequentially
- **Revisions**: Go back and reconsider earlier assumptions
- **Branching**: Explore multiple solution paths simultaneously
- **Dynamic adjustment**: Increase or decrease total thoughts as needed

| **Routine operations**    | File operations, simple refactors             |

### Token Cost

**Typical usage:** ~1,500-2,500 tokens per thinking session

Consider this overhead when deciding whether to invoke the tool.

---

## 6. USAGE

### Invocation

Sequential Thinking is a **native MCP tool** - call it directly:

```typescript
sequential_thinking_sequentialthinking({
  thought: "Your current thinking step",
  thoughtNumber: 1,
  totalThoughts: 5,
  nextThoughtNeeded: true
})
```

### Natural Language Triggers

The AI will typically invoke this tool when you:

```
Think through this step by step...
Analyze this systematically...
I need to work through a complex decision about...
Help me reason through this problem...
Think hard about this...
```

### Thinking Patterns

**Linear Analysis:**
```
Thought 1 → Thought 2 → Thought 3 → Conclusion
```

**With Revision:**
```
Thought 1 → Thought 2 → Revise Thought 1 → Thought 3 → Conclusion
```

**With Branching:**
```
Thought 1 → Thought 2 → Branch A: Thought 3a → ...
                      ↘ Branch B: Thought 3b → ...
```

## 8. EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Basic Analysis

```typescript
// Thought 1
sequential_thinking_sequentialthinking({
  thought: "Analyzing the authentication flow. Current implementation uses JWT tokens stored in localStorage, which has XSS vulnerability concerns.",
  thoughtNumber: 1,
  totalThoughts: 4,
  nextThoughtNeeded: true
})

// Thought 2
sequential_thinking_sequentialthinking({
  thought: "Alternative approaches: 1) HttpOnly cookies (better security), 2) Session tokens (stateful), 3) Token rotation (complexity trade-off).",
  thoughtNumber: 2,
  totalThoughts: 4,
  nextThoughtNeeded: true
})

// Thought 3
sequential_thinking_sequentialthinking({
  thought: "HttpOnly cookies provide XSS protection with minimal implementation changes. Need to handle CSRF separately.",
  thoughtNumber: 3,
  totalThoughts: 4,
  nextThoughtNeeded: true
})

// Thought 4 - Conclusion
sequential_thinking_sequentialthinking({
  thought: "Recommendation: Migrate to HttpOnly cookies with SameSite=Strict. Add CSRF token for state-changing requests. Implementation effort: ~4 hours.",
  thoughtNumber: 4,
  totalThoughts: 4,
  nextThoughtNeeded: false
})
```

### Example 2: With Revision

```typescript
// Thought 1
sequential_thinking_sequentialthinking({
  thought: "Initial assumption: The performance issue is in the database query.",
  thoughtNumber: 1,
  totalThoughts: 5,
  nextThoughtNeeded: true
})

// Thought 2
sequential_thinking_sequentialthinking({
  thought: "Query profiling shows 50ms response time - actually quite fast.",
  thoughtNumber: 2,
  totalThoughts: 5,
  nextThoughtNeeded: true
})

// Thought 3 - Revising Thought 1
sequential_thinking_sequentialthinking({
  thought: "Revising my earlier assumption: The bottleneck is NOT in the database. Looking at network waterfall, the issue is N+1 API calls from the frontend.",
  thoughtNumber: 3,
  totalThoughts: 5,
  isRevision: true,
  revisesThought: 1,
  nextThoughtNeeded: true
})

// Continue with corrected understanding...
```

### Example 3: With Branching

```typescript
// Thought 1
sequential_thinking_sequentialthinking({
  thought: "Need to choose between microservices and monolith for the new e-commerce platform.",
  thoughtNumber: 1,
  totalThoughts: 6,
  nextThoughtNeeded: true
})

// Thought 2 - Branch A: Microservices
sequential_thinking_sequentialthinking({
  thought: "Branch A - Microservices: Better scalability, independent deployments. But: Team of 5 developers, 3-month timeline. Risk of over-engineering.",
  thoughtNumber: 2,
  totalThoughts: 6,
  branchFromThought: 1,
  branchId: "microservices",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true
})

// Thought 3 - Branch B: Monolith
sequential_thinking_sequentialthinking({
  thought: "Branch B - Monolith: Faster initial development, simpler deployment. Can extract services later when team/scale grows.",
  thoughtNumber: 3,
  totalThoughts: 6,
  branchFromThought: 1,
  branchId: "monolith",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true
})

// Thought 4 - Compare branches and conclude
sequential_thinking_sequentialthinking({
  thought: "Comparing branches: Given team size and timeline, monolith wins. Can adopt 'modular monolith' pattern for future extraction.",
  thoughtNumber: 4,
  totalThoughts: 6,
  nextThoughtNeeded: true
})
```

## 9. TROUBLESHOOTING

### Tool Not Appearing

**Problem**: `sequential_thinking_sequentialthinking` tool not visible

**Solutions**:

1. **Restart your AI client** (OpenCode, VS Code, Claude Desktop)

2. **Verify Node.js version**
   ```bash
   node --version  # Must be 18+
   ```

3. **Test npx directly**
   ```bash
   npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking --help
   ```

4. **Check configuration syntax**
   ```bash
   # Validate JSON
   python3 -m json.tool < opencode.json
   ```

5. **Check for typos in config**
   - Server name: `sequential_thinking` (underscore, not hyphen)
   - Args: `["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking"]`

### npx Errors

**Problem**: npx fails to run the package

**Solutions**:

1. **Clear npm cache**
   ```bash
   npm cache clean --force
   ```

2. **Check network/proxy**
   ```bash
   npm config get proxy
   npm config get https-proxy
   ```

3. **Try global install as fallback**
   ```bash
   npm install -g @modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking
   ```

### Tool Invocation Fails

**Problem**: Tool appears but fails when called

**Solutions**:

1. **Check parameter types** - Ensure `thoughtNumber` and `totalThoughts` are integers, not strings

2. **Verify required parameters** - All four required parameters must be provided

3. **Check boolean values** - Use `true`/`false`, not strings
