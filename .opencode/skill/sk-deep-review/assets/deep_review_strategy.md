# Deep Review Strategy - Session Tracking Template

Runtime template copied into the resolved `{artifact_dir}/` during initialization. Tracks review progress across iterations.

## 1. OVERVIEW

### Purpose

Serves as the "persistent brain" for a deep review session. Records which dimensions remain, what was found (P0/P1/P2), what review approaches worked or failed, and where to focus next. Read by the orchestrator and agents at every iteration.

### Usage

- **Init:** Orchestrator copies this template to `{artifact_dir}/deep-review-strategy.md` and populates Topic, Review Dimensions, Known Context, and Review Boundaries from config and memory context.
- **Per iteration:** Agent reads Next Focus, reviews the assigned dimension/files, updates findings, marks dimensions complete, and sets new Next Focus.
- **Mutability:** Mutable — updated by both orchestrator and agents throughout the session.
- **Protection:** None (shared mutable state). Orchestrator validates consistency on resume.
- **Ownership:** Machine-managed metrics and coverage blocks are wrapped in explicit ownership markers. Human commentary and operator overrides live outside those markers.

## 2. TOPIC
[Review target description from config -- set during initialization]

---

## 3. REVIEW DIMENSIONS (remaining)
<!-- MACHINE-OWNED: START -->
- [ ] D1 Correctness — Logic errors, off-by-one, wrong return types, broken invariants
- [ ] D2 Security — Injection, auth bypass, secrets exposure, unsafe deserialization
- [ ] D3 Traceability — Spec/code alignment, checklist evidence, cross-reference integrity
- [ ] D4 Maintainability — Patterns, clarity, documentation quality, safe follow-on change cost
<!-- MACHINE-OWNED: END -->

---

## 4. NON-GOALS
[What this review session is NOT trying to assess -- populated during initialization]

---

## 5. STOP CONDITIONS
[Explicit conditions beyond convergence that should end the session -- populated during initialization]

---

## 6. COMPLETED DIMENSIONS
<!-- MACHINE-OWNED: START -->
[None yet -- populated as iterations complete dimension reviews]

| Dimension | Verdict | Iteration | Summary |
|-----------|---------|-----------|---------|
| [D1 Correctness] | [PASS/CONDITIONAL/FAIL] | [N] | [1-sentence result] |
<!-- MACHINE-OWNED: END -->

---

## 7. RUNNING FINDINGS
<!-- MACHINE-OWNED: START -->
- **P0 (Critical):** 0 active
- **P1 (Major):** 0 active
- **P2 (Minor):** 0 active
- **Delta this iteration:** +0 P0, +0 P1, +0 P2

[Findings are tracked in `deep-review-findings-registry.json`. This section provides a running count summary updated after each iteration.]
<!-- MACHINE-OWNED: END -->

---

## 8. WHAT WORKED
[First iteration -- populated after iteration 1 completes]
- [Approach]: [Why it worked] (iteration N)

---

## 9. WHAT FAILED
[First iteration -- populated after iteration 1 completes]
- [Approach]: [Why it failed] (iteration N)

---

## 10. EXHAUSTED APPROACHES (do not retry)
[Populated when a review approach has been tried from multiple angles without yielding new findings]

### [Category Name] -- BLOCKED (iteration N, N attempts)
- What was tried: [specific review approaches attempted]
- Why blocked: [root cause of exhaustion]
- Do NOT retry: [explicit prohibition]

### [Category Name] -- PRODUCTIVE (iteration N)
- What worked: [successful review approaches in this category]
- Prefer for: [related dimensions where this category may help]

---

## 11. RULED OUT DIRECTIONS
[Review angles that were investigated and definitively eliminated -- consolidated from iteration dead-end data]
- [Approach]: [Why ruled out] (iteration N, evidence: [source])

---

## 12. NEXT FOCUS
<!-- MACHINE-OWNED: START -->
[Recommended focus area for the next iteration -- updated at end of each iteration. Includes target dimension and/or specific files to review.]
<!-- MACHINE-OWNED: END -->

---

## 13. KNOWN CONTEXT
[Populated during initialization from memory_context() results, if any prior work exists]

---

## 14. CROSS-REFERENCE STATUS
<!-- MACHINE-OWNED: START -->
[Alignment checks completed across core and overlay protocols]

| Protocol | Level | Status | Iteration | Notes |
|----------|-------|--------|-----------|-------|
| `spec_code` | core | [pending/pass/partial/fail/blocked] | [N] | [details] |
| `checklist_evidence` | core | [pending/pass/partial/fail/blocked] | [N] | [details] |

| `playbook_capability` | overlay | [pending/pass/partial/fail/blocked/notApplicable] | [N] | [details] |
<!-- MACHINE-OWNED: END -->

[Per-file coverage state table -- populated during initialization from scope discovery]

| File | Dimensions Reviewed | Last Iteration | Findings | Status |
|------|-------------------|----------------|----------|--------|
| [path/to/file] | [D1, D3] | [N] | [0 P0, 1 P1, 2 P2] | [partial/complete] |
<!-- MACHINE-OWNED: END -->

## 17. EXAMPLE (POPULATED)

Reference snippet showing a partially populated strategy file mid-review. Use this as a visual anchor when opening a live strategy doc.

```markdown
## 1. REVIEW CHARTER
- Target: .opencode/skill/sk-deep-research (skill, v1.4.0)
- Dimensions: correctness, test-coverage, cross-runtime-parity, observability
- Stop conditions: rolling newInfoRatio < 0.08 for 2 iterations OR all dimensions converged OR max=7 reached
- Success criteria: zero P0 in correctness; test-coverage P0 resolved or deferred with rationale

## 4. NEXT FOCUS
- Dimension: test-coverage
- Files: .opencode/skill/sk-deep-research/scripts/reduce-state.cjs, .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/tests/deep-research-contract-parity.vitest.ts
- Why: Iteration 2 surfaced a P0 (convergence-path coverage gap); needs a focused follow-up before correctness can terminate PASS.

## 9. COVERAGE MATRIX
| Dimension            | Status     | Iterations touched |
|----------------------|------------|--------------------|
| correctness          | converged  | 1                  |
| test-coverage        | converging | 2, 4               |
| cross-runtime-parity | converging | 3                  |
| observability        | converging | 4                  |
```
