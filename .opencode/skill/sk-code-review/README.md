# sk-code-review

`sk-code-review` is the findings-first review baseline. It enforces severity, evidence, security, and correctness rules. For stack/surface conventions, pair it with `sk-code` surface evidence. `sk-code` is the source of truth for available surfaces.

---

## Overview

Every review starts with findings, not summaries. Findings carry severity labels (`P0`, `P1`, `P2`), file:line evidence, risk, user impact, and recommended fixes.

The old `sk-code-*` overlay model is retired. Review now uses:

```text
sk-code-review baseline -> sk-code surface evidence -> findings-first output
```

| Surface Evidence | Use When |
| --- | --- |
| `sk-code:<surface>` | `sk-code` has detected the stack or code surface |
| Baseline-only | Surface is unclear; review baseline-only and disclose uncertainty |

---

## Quick Start

1. Activate `sk-code-review` for review/audit/security/quality-gate requests.
2. Load baseline references: `review_core`, `review_ux_single_pass`, `security_checklist`, and `code_quality_checklist`.
3. Load `sk-code` and use its detected surface resources as standards evidence.
4. Report findings in P0/P1/P2 order with file:line evidence.
