## 1. OVERVIEW

`hooks/` covers three distinct concerns that share a directory but serve different lifecycles:

1. **Runtime startup hooks** — external hook scripts registered with each runtime (Claude, Gemini, Copilot, Codex) that run at session start and transport the compact startup shared-payload (`graphQualitySummary`, `sharedPayloadTransport`, etc.) produced by the MCP server.
2. **Prompt-time skill-advisor hooks** — external hook scripts that fire on each user prompt, call the native advisor, and deliver the advisor brief through the runtime's `additionalContext` or managed-instructions surface.
3. **In-process helper modules** — helpers exported via `index.ts` for memory surfacing, mutation UX feedback, and response-hint injection.

Each concern has its own subsection below. The helper modules are a utility layer; the runtime startup and prompt-time hooks are standalone external processes registered with the host runtime.

For packet work, hook output should align with `/spec_kit:resume` and the canonical continuity chain `handover.md -> _memory.continuity -> spec docs`, with generated memory artifacts treated as supporting context only.

### 1.1 Runtime Startup Hooks

All four supported runtimes now transport the same compact startup shared-payload through their runtime-specific startup hooks. Each hook reads the structural snapshot produced by `buildStartupBrief()` (including `graphQualitySummary`, `sharedPayload`, and `sharedPayloadTransport`) and injects it through the runtime's native transport:

| Runtime | Entrypoint | Registration Surface | Transport |
|---------|------------|----------------------|-----------|
| Claude | `claude/session-prime.ts` | `.claude/settings.local.json` `SessionStart` | stdout context injection (routes by source: compact/startup/resume/clear) |
| Gemini | `gemini/session-prime.ts` | `.gemini/settings.json` `SessionStart` (or equivalent) | startup brief injection at session priming |
| Copilot | `copilot/session-prime.ts` | wrapper/hook config + managed custom-instructions refresh | writes the compact shared-payload envelope into the managed block in `$HOME/.copilot/copilot-instructions.md` |
| Codex | `codex/session-start.ts` | `~/.codex/hooks.json` with `[features].codex_hooks = true` in `~/.codex/config.toml` | native `SessionStart` hook injection |

`session_bootstrap()` remains available as a manual fallback when native startup hooks are disabled or unwired; it is no longer a Codex-only substitute. Copilot no longer has "varies by environment" behavior — the managed custom-instructions refresh is the defined startup transport.

### 1.2 Prompt-Time Skill-Advisor Hooks

Prompt-time advisor hooks fire on each user prompt, call the native advisor, and deliver the brief:

| Runtime | Entrypoint | Registration Surface |
|---------|------------|----------------------|
| Claude | `claude/user-prompt-submit.ts` | `.claude/settings.local.json` |
| Gemini | `gemini/user-prompt-submit.ts` | `.gemini/settings.json` `BeforeAgent` |
| Copilot | `copilot/user-prompt-submit.ts` | SDK `onUserPromptSubmitted` or wrapper hook config |
| Codex | `codex/user-prompt-submit.ts` | `~/.codex/hooks.json` (`UserPromptSubmit`) with `[features].codex_hooks = true`; prompt-wrapper fallback available |

OpenCode delivers the advisor via `.opencode/plugins/spec-kit-skill-advisor.js` + `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/plugin_bridges/spec-kit-skill-advisor-bridge.mjs`, which imports the stable native compat entrypoint. The default prompt-time threshold contract is `0.8` (confidence) / `0.35` (uncertainty).

Packet 014 unified the threshold/render contract across OpenCode and Codex: both now use the shared `renderAdvisorBrief(...)` path and the shared builder/timeout/threshold contract. Diagnostics for all runtime hook surfaces persist to bounded JSONL sinks under the temp metrics root so `advisor_validate` analysis can read them back across processes.

Operator contract: `../../references/hooks/skill-advisor-hook.md`.

### 1.3 In-Process Helper Modules

Helper modules exported via `index.ts`:

- `memory-surface.ts`: context extraction, constitutional/triggered memory surfacing, lifecycle hook helpers, and constitutional cache management.
- `mutation-feedback.ts`: post-mutation feedback payloads and hint strings for cache clear results and tool cache invalidation.
- `response-hints.ts`: auto-surface hint injection plus MCP JSON envelope metadata and token-count synchronization.

This in-process layer is a utility surface for memory-aware context surfacing and UX feedback metadata — distinct from the runtime hook scripts above, which run as external processes triggered by the host runtime. Subsection 1.1 (startup) and 1.2 (prompt-time) are the operator-facing hook registration surfaces.

See `claude/README.md` for details on the Claude-side wiring and `references/config/hook_system.md` for the canonical cross-runtime registration matrix.

## 2. IMPLEMENTED STATE


Main exports (camelCase):
- `extractContextHint(args)`
- `getConstitutionalMemories()`
- `clearConstitutionalCache()`
- `autoSurfaceMemories(contextHint)`
- `autoSurfaceAtToolDispatch(toolName, toolArgs, options)`
- `autoSurfaceAtCompaction(sessionContext, options)`
- `MEMORY_AWARE_TOOLS`
- `buildMutationHookFeedback(operation, hookResult)`
- `appendAutoSurfaceHints(result, autoSurfacedContext)`
- `syncEnvelopeTokenCount(envelope)`
- `serializeEnvelopeWithTokenCount(envelope)`

Data shape:
- `extractContextHint(args)` pulls the first usable string from `input`, `query`, `prompt`, `specFolder`, or `filePath`, and falls back to joining `concepts[]` when present.
- auto-surface output includes `constitutional`, `triggered`, `surfaced_at`, and `latencyMs`.
- post-mutation runtime first produces `MutationHookResult` via `runPostMutationHooks()` in `../handlers/mutation-hooks.ts`, then `buildMutationHookFeedback()` maps that into the public `postMutationHooks` payload used by mutation responses.
- `MutationHookResult` includes `latencyMs`, `triggerCacheCleared`, `constitutionalCacheCleared`, `graphSignalsCacheCleared`, `coactivationCacheCleared`, `toolCacheInvalidated`, and `errors`.
- public `postMutationHooks` data includes `operation`, `latencyMs`, `triggerCacheCleared`, `constitutionalCacheCleared`, `graphSignalsCacheCleared`, `coactivationCacheCleared`, and `toolCacheInvalidated`.
- auto-surface response hints enrich the MCP JSON envelope `hints` and `meta.autoSurface`.
- `MEMORY_AWARE_TOOLS` currently includes `memory_context`, `memory_search`, `memory_match_triggers`, `memory_list`, `memory_save`, and `memory_index_scan`.

## 3. HARDENING NOTES


- Constitutional cache uses a short TTL (60s) to reduce DB churn.
- Trigger matching uses fast phrase matching and returns empty/null safely on failures.
- Hook output remains compatible with current formatter and tool response contracts.
