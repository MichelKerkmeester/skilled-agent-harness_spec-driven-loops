## 1. 📖 OVERVIEW

This section provides an overview of the MCP Server Configuration Files directory.

`configs/` currently contains:

- `search-weights.json`

This file is partly active and partly legacy/reference. Its inline notes are the source of truth for what is currently loaded at runtime.

<!-- ANCHOR:implemented-state -->
## 2. 📌 IMPLEMENTED STATE


Current sections in `search-weights.json`:

- `documentTypeMultipliers` (Spec 126): active scoring reference for 11 document types.
- `maxTriggersPerMemory`: active cap used by trigger-related flows.
- `smartRanking`: marked as partially legacy in comments.
- `rrfFusion`: marked as dead config in comments.
- `crossEncoder`: marked as dead config in comments.

Important: canonical scoring behavior lives in TypeScript modules (not this README), primarily `lib/scoring/composite-scoring.ts` and related handlers.

## 3. 📝 HARDENING NOTES


- Spec 126 added document-type multiplier coverage aligned to schema/document-type indexing.
- Spec 125 audit documented dead/legacy config sections to reduce ambiguity.
- Treat this folder as config reference plus transition notes until legacy paths are fully removed.
