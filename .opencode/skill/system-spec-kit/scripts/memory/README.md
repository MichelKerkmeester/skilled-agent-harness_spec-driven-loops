## 1. OVERVIEW

The `memory/` directory contains the CLI entrypoints for the Spec Kit memory pipeline.

This is the **canonical location** for reindex and memory operations documentation.
Other locations point here: `mcp_server/scripts/README.md`, `mcp_server/database/README.md`

## 2. CURRENT INVENTORY


- `generate-context.ts` - update canonical packet continuity and supporting generated context artifacts from spec-folder or JSON input
- `rank-memories.ts` - rank memory candidates by scoring rules
- `cleanup-orphaned-vectors.ts` - remove stale vector rows not linked to active memories
- `validate-memory-quality.ts` - validates post-render memory quality against scoring thresholds before indexing/reporting; includes post-save quality gates (structure, semantic sufficiency, duplicate detection), heuristic calibration, and trigger sanitization
- `reindex-embeddings.ts` - force full embedding reindex across memory/spec documents
- `ast-parser.ts` - parse markdown into heading/code/table-aware sections
- `backfill-frontmatter.ts` - bulk frontmatter normalization for templates, spec docs, and supporting generated context artifacts
- `rebuild-auto-entities.ts` - rebuild auto-entity metadata from indexed content
- `fix-memory-h1.mjs` - One-shot migration script — fixes H1 heading format in older generated memory artifacts

Runtime files are compiled into `../dist/memory/`.

## 3. MEMORY SAVE RULE COMMANDS


Routine JSON mode:

```bash
node .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/dist/memory/generate-context.js \
  --json '{"specFolder":"NNN-name","user_prompts":["Summarize the session"],"observations":["Capture the concrete outcome"],"recent_context":["List touched docs, commands, and verification"]}' \
  specs/<###-spec-name>
```

Explicit CLI targets are authoritative, including policy-defined phase folders. `generate-context.js` now updates the canonical continuity surfaces for the target packet through a single canonical path.

JSON input mode:

```bash
node .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/dist/memory/generate-context.js \
  /tmp/save-context-data-<session-id>.json \
  specs/NNN-name
```

## 4. MAINTENANCE COMMANDS


```bash
node .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/dist/memory/rank-memories.js /tmp/memories.json
node .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/dist/memory/cleanup-orphaned-vectors.js
node .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/dist/memory/reindex-embeddings.js
node .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/dist/memory/backfill-frontmatter.js --dry-run --include-archive
node .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/dist/memory/backfill-frontmatter.js --apply --include-archive --report /tmp/frontmatter-apply.json
```

## 5. WORKFLOW ALIGNMENT


- Uses the modular core/extractors/loaders/renderers/lib pipeline.
- Supports subfolder-aware spec path handling through core utilities.
- Produces ANCHOR-structured markdown expected by downstream validation and indexing.
- Enforces the shared rendered-memory contract before successful write/index so malformed anchors, ids, frontmatter, or cleanup artifacts do not persist as active memories.
- Uses content-aware candidate selection so task/session evidence beats generic packet defaults when valid.
- Derives `MEMORY_TITLE` from the content slug via `slugToTitle(contentSlug)` and writes it into the H1 heading. A blank line separates the frontmatter close `---` from the `# H1`.
- Writes `MEMORY_DASHBOARD_TITLE` into context template frontmatter so dashboard titles stay disambiguated.
- Runs post-render memory quality validation so contaminated headings or stale decision leaks are caught after template population. The post-save quality pipeline includes 3-layer gates (structure, semantic sufficiency, duplicate detection), heuristic calibration for scoring thresholds, and trigger sanitization to prevent noisy or over-broad trigger phrases from persisting in the index.
- Retroactive title refresh for existing memories: run `memory_index_scan({ force: true })` after parser/template updates.

<!-- ANCHOR:frontmatter-normalization-reindex -->
## 6. FRONTMATTER NORMALIZATION + REINDEX

Use the backfill CLI to normalize indexed markdown metadata across templates, spec docs, and supporting generated context artifacts.

Managed keys:
- `title`
- `description`
- `trigger_phrases`
- `importance_tier`
- `contextType` (parser also accepts `context_type` alias)

Typical migration workflow:

```bash
# Dry-run first (strict mode by default: malformed frontmatter fails)
node .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/dist/memory/backfill-frontmatter.js \
  --dry-run --include-archive --report /tmp/frontmatter-dry-run.json

# Apply once dry-run output is clean
node .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/dist/memory/backfill-frontmatter.js \
  --apply --include-archive --report /tmp/frontmatter-apply.json

# Reindex embeddings so dashboard/search reflects updated metadata
node .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/dist/memory/reindex-embeddings.js

To target specific roots, pass `--roots`:

```bash
node .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/dist/memory/backfill-frontmatter.js \
  --dry-run --roots ./.opencode/specs,./specs --report /tmp/frontmatter-targeted.json
```

If you need compatibility mode during staged cleanup, use `--allow-malformed` to keep processing without non-zero exit on malformed frontmatter files.
