# Template anchor optimization

## Current Reality

Anchor markers in memory files (structured sections like `<!-- ANCHOR:state -->`) are parsed and attached as metadata to search pipeline rows. The module extracts anchor IDs and derives semantic types from structured IDs (for example, `DECISION-pipeline-003` yields type `DECISION`). Simple IDs like `summary` pass through as-is.

This is a pure annotation step wired into Stage 2 as step 8. It never modifies any score fields. The enrichment makes Stage 3 (rerank) and Stage 4 (filter) anchor-aware without score side-effects. No feature flag; always active.
