# ✓ Verification Checklist

Universal checklist for verifying work before claiming completion across TypeScript/JavaScript, Go, and Swift.

---

<!-- ANCHOR:overview -->
## 1. OVERVIEW

### Purpose

**The Iron Law**: Evidence before claims, always. This checklist ensures all completion claims are backed by actual testing evidence.

### Usage

Use this checklist BEFORE claiming any work is complete, fixed, or working. Complete all applicable sections for your stack before making completion claims.

### Language Coverage

| Language | Primary Testing Environment |
|----------|---------------------------|
| TypeScript/JavaScript | Browser, Node.js, Jest/Vitest |
| Go | go test, benchmarks |
| Swift | XCTest, Xcode, Simulator/Device |

<!-- ANCHOR:before-claiming-anything -->
## 2. BEFORE CLAIMING ANYTHING

- [ ] **I have actually run the code** (not just reviewed it)
- [ ] **I have tested the actual functionality** (not assumed it works)
- [ ] **I have seen it work** (not trusted code review alone)
- [ ] **I can describe exactly what I observed** (have specific evidence)

**If you cannot check ALL four boxes above, your claim is premature.**

## 11. DOCUMENTATION

### Evidence Recorded

- [ ] Noted which environments tested
- [ ] Listed test commands run
- [ ] Described what was observed
- [ ] Documented specific behavior seen
- [ ] Captured performance metrics

### Claim Format

- [ ] Stated what was tested explicitly
- [ ] Included test results summary
- [ ] Noted any limitations
- [ ] Specified testing environment

### Example Claim Format

**Good Claim:**
```
Tested on Chrome/Firefox at 1920px and 375px. All automated tests
pass (42/42). Manual testing confirms login flow works. DevTools
console clear, no errors. Performance within targets (LCP 1.2s).
```

**Bad Claim:**
```
Code looks correct
Should work now
Tested and it's fine
```

## 12. RED FLAGS TO AVOID

**Did NOT think:**

- [ ] "Code looks correct, should work"
- [ ] "Tests pass, must be fine"
- [ ] "Quick test later"
- [ ] "One environment is enough"
- [ ] "That warning isn't important"
- [ ] "Can verify after deploy"
- [ ] "Looks good to me" (without testing)

**If you thought ANY of these -> STOP and test properly.**

## 13. FINAL VERIFICATION

### Can You Answer These?

- [ ] What exactly did you observe when testing?
- [ ] Which environments did you test?
- [ ] What test commands did you run and what were results?
- [ ] Were there any errors or warnings?
- [ ] Did you test the actual user workflow?
- [ ] Did you test from start to finish?

**If you cannot answer ALL questions -> Test more thoroughly.**
