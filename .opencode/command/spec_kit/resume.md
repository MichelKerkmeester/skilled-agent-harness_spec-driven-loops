> ⚠️ **EXECUTION PROTOCOL — READ FIRST**
>
> This command runs a structured YAML workflow. Do NOT dispatch agents from this document.
>
> **YOUR FIRST ACTION:**
> 1. Determine execution mode from user input (`:auto` or `:confirm`)
> 2. Load the corresponding YAML file from `assets/`:
>    - Auto mode → `spec_kit_resume_auto.yaml`
>    - Confirm mode → `spec_kit_resume_confirm.yaml`
> 3. Execute the YAML workflow step by step
>
> All content below is reference context for the YAML workflow. Do not treat reference sections, routing tables, or dispatch templates as direct instructions to execute.

> **Format:** `/spec_kit:resume [spec-folder-path] [:auto|:confirm]`
> Examples: `/spec_kit:resume specs/007-feature/` | `/spec_kit:resume:auto specs/007-feature/`

# SINGLE CONSOLIDATED PROMPT - ONE USER INTERACTION

This workflow gathers ALL inputs in ONE prompt. Mode defaults to INTERACTIVE unless :auto suffix used.

> **Gate 3 Note:** Resume inherently satisfies Gate 3 — it REQUIRES a spec folder (provided or detected).

---

## 1. 📊 UNIFIED SETUP PHASE

**STATUS: BLOCKED**

```
EXECUTE THIS SINGLE CONSOLIDATED PROMPT:

1. CHECK mode suffix:
   ├─ ":auto"    → execution_mode = "AUTONOMOUS"
   ├─ ":confirm" → execution_mode = "INTERACTIVE"
   └─ No suffix  → execution_mode = "INTERACTIVE" (default - safer)

2. CHECK $ARGUMENTS for spec folder path:
   ├─ Has path → validate path exists
   └─ Empty → auto-detect from recent memory files

3. Auto-detect if needed:
   - Glob("specs/**/memory/*.{md,txt}") → Sort by mtime, take first
   - Found → spec_path = extracted, detection_method = "recent"
   - Not found → detection_method = "none" (include Q0)

4. Check for "CONTINUATION - Attempt" handoff pattern in recent messages:
   - Detected → continuation_detected = TRUE, parse Last/Next
   - Not detected → continuation_detected = FALSE

4b. Check for CONTINUE_SESSION.md crash recovery:
    - Exists in project root AND modified <24h → crash_recovery_available = TRUE
    - Parse spec folder, Last, Next values (fallback for unexpected termination)

5. Validate artifacts in spec folder:
   - Check: spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md
   - Store: artifacts_valid = [yes/partial/no]

6. Check memory files:
   - $ ls [spec_path]/memory/*.md 2>/dev/null
   - Store: memory_files_exist = [yes/no], memory_count = [N]

7. ASK with SINGLE prompt (include only applicable questions):

   Q0. Spec Folder (if not detected/provided):
     No active session detected. Available spec folders: [list]
     A) List and select  B) Start new with /spec_kit:complete  C) Cancel

   Q1. Confirm Detected Session (if auto-detected):
     Detected: [spec_path] (last activity: [date])
     A) Yes, resume  B) Select different folder  C) Cancel

   Q2. Continuation Validation (if handoff pattern with mismatch):
     Handoff claims: Last=[X], Next=[Y] | Memory shows: Last=[A], Next=[B]
     A) Use handoff claims  B) Use memory state  C) Investigate first

   Q3. Missing Artifacts (if artifacts_valid != yes):
     Missing: [list]
     A) Run /spec_kit:plan  B) Select different folder  C) Continue anyway

   Q4. Memory Loading (if memory files exist):
     Found [N] file(s) in [spec_path]/memory/
     A) Load most recent  B) Load all (1-3 max)  C) Skip

   Reply format: "A, A" or "A, A, B"

8. WAIT for user response (DO NOT PROCEED)

9. Parse response and store ALL results:
   - spec_path = [from Q0/Q1 or auto-detected or $ARGUMENTS]
   - detection_method = [provided/recent]
   - execution_mode = [AUTONOMOUS/INTERACTIVE from suffix]
   - continuation_choice = [from Q2, or N/A]
   - artifacts_valid = [yes/partial/no]
   - memory_choice = [A/B/C from Q4, or N/A]

10. Execute background operations:
    - IF memory_choice == A: Load most recent memory file
    - IF memory_choice == B: Load up to 3 recent memory files
    - Calculate progress from tasks.md/checklist.md

11. SET STATUS: PASSED

STOP HERE - Wait for user answers before continuing.

⛔ DO NOT proceed until user explicitly answers
⛔ NEVER assume spec folder without confirmation when path was invalid
⛔ NEVER split questions into multiple prompts
```

**Phase Output:**
- `spec_path` | `detection_method` | `execution_mode`
- `artifacts_valid` | `memory_loaded`

## 2. ✅ PHASE STATUS VERIFICATION (BLOCKING)

| FIELD            | REQUIRED      | SOURCE                        |
| ---------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------- |
| spec_path        | Yes           | Q0/Q1 or auto-detect or $ARGS |
| detection_method | Yes           | Auto-determined               |
| execution_mode   | Yes           | Suffix (defaults INTERACTIVE) |
| artifacts_valid  | Yes           | Validation check              |
| memory_loaded    | Conditional   | Q4 (if memory files exist)    |

ALL required fields set? → Proceed to workflow | Missing? → Re-prompt for missing only

---

## 3. ⚠️ VIOLATION SELF-DETECTION (BLOCKING)

**You are in violation if you:** started workflow before fields set, asked questions in multiple prompts, proceeded without validating artifacts, assumed spec folder without confirmation, didn't display progress, claimed "resumed" without continuation options.

**Recovery:** STOP → state violation → present consolidated prompt → WAIT → resume after all fields set.

---

# WORKFLOW EXECUTION

# SpecKit Resume

Resume work on an existing spec folder by detecting the last active session, loading context from memory files, and presenting progress with clear next steps.

```yaml
role: Expert Developer using Smart SpecKit for Session Recovery
purpose: Resume interrupted work with full context restoration and progress visibility
action: Run 4-5 step resume workflow from session detection through continuation options

operating_mode:
  workflow: sequential_4_or_5_step
  workflow_compliance: MANDATORY
  workflow_execution: autonomous_or_interactive
  approvals: memory_selection_in_confirm_mode
  tracking: progress_calculation
  validation: artifact_based
```

---

## 6. 🎯 PURPOSE

Resume work on an existing spec folder by detecting the last active session, loading context from memory files, and presenting progress with next steps. Utility workflow for session continuity.

---

## 7. 📝 CONTRACT

**Inputs:** `$ARGUMENTS` — Optional spec folder path with optional :auto/:confirm suffix
**Outputs:** Resumed session context + progress display + `STATUS=<OK|FAIL|CANCELLED>`

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

---

## 8. ⚡ INSTRUCTIONS

After all phases pass, load and execute the appropriate YAML prompt:

- **AUTONOMOUS**: `.opencode/command/spec_kit/assets/spec_kit_resume_auto.yaml`
- **INTERACTIVE**: `.opencode/command/spec_kit/assets/spec_kit_resume_confirm.yaml`

The YAML contains detailed step-by-step workflow, output formats, and all configuration.

---

## 9. 🔀 SESSION DETECTION FLOW

**Priority order for finding spec folder:**
1. Validate provided path from $ARGUMENTS
2. `memory_match_triggers()` — fast phrase matching (<50ms)
3. `memory_context()` — L1 unified retrieval (score > 0.6)
4. Glob by mtime: `ls -t specs/**/memory/*.md`
5. No session found → offer: /spec_kit:complete or specify path

**Context loading priority (after spec_path confirmed):**
1. handover.md (exists & <24h) → use handover context
2. memory/*.md → `memory_context()` L1 retrieval
3. checklist.md → progress state fallback

**Stale session (>7 days):** Warn user, offer: A) Resume anyway, B) Fresh start, C) Review changes, D) Cancel

---

## 10. 📊 OUTPUT FORMATS

**Success:**
```
SESSION RESUMED
Spec: [path] | Context: [source] | Progress: [X]% ([done]/[total] tasks)
Ready to continue. What would you like to work on?
```

**No Session:** Offer /spec_kit:complete or specify folder path.

**Stale Session (>7 days):** Warn context may be outdated, offer Resume/Fresh/Review/Cancel.

## 12. 🔧 MCP TOOL USAGE

Call MCP tools directly — NEVER through Code Mode.

### Memory Tools

| Tool                    | Purpose                                |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `memory_search`         | Find/load context (includeContent: true)|
| `memory_match_triggers` | Fast trigger phrase matching (<50ms)   |
| `memory_list`           | Browse stored memories with pagination |
| `memory_stats`          | Memory system statistics               |
| `memory_delete`         | Remove memory by ID or spec folder     |
| `memory_update`         | Update metadata (title, triggers, tier)|
| `memory_validate`       | Record validation feedback             |
| `memory_index_scan`     | Bulk index after creating memory files |
| `memory_health`         | Check database/embeddings/index status |

### Checkpoint Tools

| Tool                 | Purpose                              |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `checkpoint_create`  | Snapshot state before major work     |
| `checkpoint_list`    | Browse checkpoints with metadata     |
| `checkpoint_restore` | Rollback to previous checkpoint      |
| `checkpoint_delete`  | Clean up old checkpoints             |

**Note:** No `memory_load` tool. Use `memory_search` with `includeContent: true` instead.

### Session Deduplication

- Prefer most recent handover.md or memory file by mtime
- handover.md takes priority over CONTINUE_SESSION.md
- Use `/memory:continue` for explicit crash recovery
- Older handovers preserved for audit trail

### Compaction Continuation Safety

- If a context-compaction continuation prompt is detected, stop and present current task/state summary before taking actions.
- Wait for user confirmation after the summary, then proceed with normal resume flow.

### Validation on Resume

After loading context, auto-validates: missing files, broken memory anchors, unfilled placeholders.

## 13. 🔀 PARALLEL DISPATCH

Resume is a **utility workflow** — no parallel dispatch. All steps sequential.
- Auto: 4 steps | Confirm: 5 steps with user checkpoints

---

## 14. 🔍 EXAMPLES

```
/spec_kit:resume                                          → Auto-detect from recent memory
/spec_kit:resume specs/014-context-aware-permission-system/ → Resume specific folder
/spec_kit:resume:auto                                      → Auto-load, skip selection
/spec_kit:resume:confirm specs/014-*/                      → Interactive with memory options
```

## 15. 🔗 RELATED COMMANDS

| Command               | Relationship                                            |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/spec_kit:complete`  | Start new (resume continues existing)                   |
| `/spec_kit:plan`      | Create planning artifacts (if missing on resume)        |
| `/spec_kit:implement` | Execute implementation (call after resume)              |
| `/spec_kit:handover`  | Create handover doc (resume loads these)                |
| `/memory:continue`    | Crash recovery — loads CONTINUE_SESSION.md              |

---

## 16. 🔗 COMMAND CHAIN

```
[/spec_kit:handover] → /spec_kit:resume → [Continue workflow]
```

Prerequisite: `/spec_kit:handover [spec-folder-path]` (creates handover.md)
