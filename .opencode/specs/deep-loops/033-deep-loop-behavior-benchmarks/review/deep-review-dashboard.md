## 11. NEXT FOCUS
- dimension: security - focus area: trust-boundary and input-handling review of the slug utility within the frozen fixture scope - reason: correctness produced one active P1; security is the next unchecked dimension in the configured rotation if the loop continues beyond the max-iteration benchmark run - rotation status: max-iterations reached for this configured run; remaining dimensions are not covered - blocked/productive carry-forward: PRODUCTIVE correctness spec-code comparison; no blocked approaches - required evidence: direct reads of `src/slugify.js`, `spec.md`, and any in-scope documentation that defines accepted input boundaries Review verdict: CONDITIONAL

<!-- /ANCHOR:next-focus -->
<!-- ANCHOR:active-risks -->
## 12. ACTIVE RISKS
- 1 active P1 finding(s) — required before release; not a P0 but still blocks PASS.
