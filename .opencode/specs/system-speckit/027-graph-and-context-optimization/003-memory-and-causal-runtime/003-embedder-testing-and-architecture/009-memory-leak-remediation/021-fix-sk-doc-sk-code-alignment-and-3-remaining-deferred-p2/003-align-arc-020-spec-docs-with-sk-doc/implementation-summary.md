## METADATA

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Spec Folder** | 003-align-arc-020-spec-docs-with-sk-doc |
| **Status** | Completed |
| **Completed** | 2026-05-23 |
| **Level** | 2 |
| **Findings Closed** | 24 H2-case doc drifts fixed; 0 evergreen-rule violations removed |
<!-- /ANCHOR:metadata -->

<!-- ANCHOR:what-built -->
## WHAT WAS BUILT

Planned changes:

| Set | Planned Closure |
|-----|-----------------|
| Set A | Audited 36 arc 020 child docs and fixed 24 H2-case drifts |
| Set B | Audited seven skill surfaces; no evergreen or doctor-header drift found |

### Files Changed

| File | Action | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| Packet docs | Modified | Level 2 scaffold, checklist, ADR, and verification plan |
| `scratch/sk-doc-sweep-tally.csv` | Generated | Per-file audit tally |
| Arc 020 child docs | Modified | H2 ALL CAPS mechanical fixes in 24 docs |
| Listed skill surfaces | Audited | No edits needed |
<!-- /ANCHOR:what-built -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:how-delivered -->
## HOW IT WAS DELIVERED

Scaffold followed the Level 2 sibling packet shape from 021/002 and was tailored for a documentation-only sk-doc sweep. The only Set A edits were H2 heading uppercasing in arc 020 child docs; Set B was audit-only because the selected skill surfaces were already compliant.

<!-- ANCHOR:decisions -->
## KEY DECISIONS

| Decision | Why |
|----------|-----|
| Use scanner-backed minimal fixes | Prevented subjective rewrites of closed packets |
| Keep runtime skill docs untouched unless drift exists | The evergreen rule targets mutable current-state citations, not clean docs |
| Validate all packets strictly | Required by the user and completion rules |
<!-- /ANCHOR:decisions -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:verification -->
## VERIFICATION

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Scaffold strict validation | PASS: `bash .opencode/skills/system-spec-kit/scripts/spec/validate.sh <spec-folder> --strict --verbose`, errors 0, warnings 0, exit 0 |
| User Step 1 file listing | PASS: `find <arc-020> -name "*.md" -type f \| head -30` produced expected arc 020 markdown paths |
| Arc 020 child strict validation | PASS: all six child `validate.sh --strict` runs exited 0 |
| Post-fix drift scan | PASS: 36 docs audited, 24 fixed, 0 current H2/evidence/continuity violations |
| Skill-surface audit | PASS: 0 evergreen-rule violations removed; all five doctor scripts have shebang, strict mode, and component header |
| 021/003 strict validation | PASS: final `validate.sh <spec-folder> --strict` exited 0 |
| Arc 021 parent strict validation | PASS: `validate.sh <arc-021-parent> --strict` exited 0 |
<!-- /ANCHOR:verification -->

## KNOWN LIMITATIONS

1. This packet intentionally did not improve prose beyond required structure and evidence drift fixes.
2. Runtime skill surfaces were not edited because no current-state evergreen violations or doctor header drift were found.
