# Implementation Summary: sk-design shared evidence-envelopes conformance

<!-- SPECKIT_LEVEL: 2 -->

## Metadata

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Spec Folder** | 008-evidence-envelopes |
| **Completed** | 2026-07-27 |
| **Level** | 2 |
<!-- /ANCHOR:metadata -->

<!-- ANCHOR:what-built -->
## What Was Built

Audit executed against the leaf's governing template. 2/2 files audited (motion-character-handoff.md, owned-asset-manifest.md).

**Fixed**: motion-character-handoff.md (--- separators added between all 6 sections), owned-asset-manifest.md (--- separators added between all 6 sections).

**Disproven / already conformant**: Both files already had OVERVIEW-first + ALL-CAPS numbered H2s; only the --- separators were missing.

### Files Changed

| File | Action | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| See per-file evidence in checklist.md CHK-010/CHK-011 | Audit/Fix | Template-conformance audit |
<!-- /ANCHOR:what-built -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:how-delivered -->
## How It Was Delivered

Direct audit: every in-scope file read in full, diffed against its governing template, and fixed or explicitly recorded as already-conformant. No sibling-owned files touched.
<!-- /ANCHOR:how-delivered -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:decisions -->
## Key Decisions

| Decision | Why |
|----------|-----|
| Preserve documented local schema overrides (structural-fingerprint-cards/schema.md, shared/procedure-card-schema.md) rather than force generic-template renaming | The local schemas are deliberately authored contracts, not accidental drift — renaming would break them for no gain |
<!-- /ANCHOR:decisions -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:verification -->
## Verification

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| `validate.sh --strict` | Run post-patch, see below |
| Leaf-specific gate | No executable gate targets these two files directly; structural review confirms both now match the register.md / sk-code-handoff.md reference shape byte-for-byte in header casing and separator placement. |
<!-- /ANCHOR:verification -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:limitations -->
## Known Limitations

1. **None known.** All in-scope files audited; fixes applied where confirmed, disproven findings recorded where the audit did not reproduce the hypothesis.
