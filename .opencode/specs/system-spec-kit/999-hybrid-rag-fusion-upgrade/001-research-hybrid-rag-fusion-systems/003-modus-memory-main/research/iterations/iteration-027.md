## Findings

### Finding 1: Rank 1 (20/25) — explicit `memory_review` is the first thing Public should ship
- **Source**: `external/internal/mcp/memory.go:7-15`; `external/internal/mcp/vault.go:885-897`; `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/lib/cognitive/fsrs-scheduler.ts:39-43,197-215`; `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/lib/search/pipeline/stage2-fusion.ts:529-585,840-877,1194-1202`; `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/tool-schemas.ts:300-316`
- **What it does**: Modus exposes an explicit `memory_reinforce` operator action on top of its FSRS state. Public already has the underlying pieces: graded review math (`AGAIN/HARD/GOOD/EASY`), `processReview()` with `nextReviewDate`, and opt-in strengthening-on-access. The current exposed adjacent surface is `memory_validate`, which records only `wasUseful` feedback and does not let an operator issue a graded FSRS review.
- **Why it matters for us**: This is the highest impact x feasibility transfer because it closes the clearest control-plane gap without inventing new storage or changing retrieval architecture. It also de-risks the bigger `memory_due` idea: until Public has a first-class graded review action, any future review queue would have no trustworthy way to record hard recalls, lapses, and easy wins distinctly.
- **Recommendation**: **adopt now**
- **Impact**: **high**

- **Impact**: **high**

### Finding 3: Modus’s cheapest useful rehydration primitive is adjacency, not session recovery
- **Source**: [crossref.go:9](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/003-modus-memory-main/external/internal/index/crossref.go#L9); [crossref.go:41](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/003-modus-memory-main/external/internal/index/crossref.go#L41); [vault.go:75](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/003-modus-memory-main/external/internal/mcp/vault.go#L75)
- **What it does**: Modus builds lightweight subject/tag/entity adjacency maps at index time and appends connected documents to search output when they were not already returned by lexical search.
- **Why it matters**: For compaction recovery, this is the most transferable Modus idea: after we recover the active spec/task, a cheap connected-neighbor pass could widen context without immediately paying for heavier graph or semantic expansion.
- **Recommendation**: **prototype later**
- **Impact**: **medium**

### Finding 4: Modus’s automatic recall loop is too blunt to map directly onto compaction injection
- **Source**: [vault.go:287](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/003-modus-memory-main/external/internal/mcp/vault.go#L287); [vault.go:311](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/003-modus-memory-main/external/internal/mcp/vault.go#L311); [facts.go:64](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/003-modus-memory-main/external/internal/vault/facts.go#L64); [facts.go:160](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/003-modus-memory-main/external/internal/vault/facts.go#L160); [parser.go:65](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/003-modus-memory-main/external/internal/markdown/parser.go#L65); [writer.go:10](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/003-modus-memory-main/external/internal/markdown/writer.go#L10)
- **What it does**: `memory_search` reinforces every returned fact asynchronously, and reinforcement/decay write updated confidence/stability/difficulty/access metadata back into markdown frontmatter.

## Findings
### Finding N: [Title]
- **Source**: file path(s)
- **What it does**: technical description
- **Why it matters**: relevance to our system
- **Recommendation**: adopt now / prototype later / reject / NEW FEATURE
- **Impact**: high / medium / low

- **Affected repo area**: `mcp_server/handlers/memory-search.ts`, `mcp_server/lib/search/hybrid-search.ts`
- **Risk**: More routing logic increases tuning complexity, but it is far lower risk than swapping out the current hybrid stack.

### Finding 5: Lexical hot-paths deserve a pre-embedding fast lane
- **Source**: [cache.go#L10](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/003-modus-memory-main/external/internal/index/cache.go#L10); [cache.go#L39](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/003-modus-memory-main/external/internal/index/cache.go#L39); [indexer.go#L169](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/003-modus-memory-main/external/internal/index/indexer.go#L169); [memory-search.ts#L763](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/handlers/memory-search.ts#L763); [memory-search.ts#L775](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/handlers/memory-search.ts#L775)
- **What it does**: Modus checks exact and Jaccard-similar query caches before running BM25. Public’s default cache-miss path waits for embeddings and then goes through hybrid retrieval because `memory_search` defaults to `hybrid`.
- **Why it matters**: Repeated operational queries and token-stable lookups are where lexical search can beat semantic on both precision and latency.
- **Recommendation**: **prototype later**. Add a cheap pre-embedding lexical seed pass or small hot-query cache to decide whether semantic work is even needed.
- **Affected repo area**: `mcp_server/handlers/memory-search.ts`, `mcp_server/lib/search/hybrid-search.ts`
- **Risk**: Over-aggressive fuzzy cache reuse could hide new results; the cache needs explicit audit metadata and conservative thresholds.

### Finding 6: `lexicalPath` and `fallbackState` should become routing inputs, not just diagnostics
- **Source**: [sqlite-fts.ts#L28](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/lib/search/sqlite-fts.ts#L28); [sqlite-fts.ts#L92](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/lib/search/sqlite-fts.ts#L92); [sqlite-fts.ts#L208](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/lib/search/sqlite-fts.ts#L208); [memory-search.ts#L904](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/handlers/memory-search.ts#L904); [README.md#L173](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/lib/search/README.md#L173)
- **What it does**: Public already records whether the lexical lane actually ran (`fts5` vs `unavailable`) and why (`ok`, `missing_table`, `bm25_runtime_failure`, etc.), but it currently exposes that mainly as metadata.
- **Why it matters**: A hybrid strategy should react to lane availability. If lexical is unavailable, semantic should skip lexical reformulation and lean harder on vector/graph. If lexical is healthy and the query is exact, the system can safely bias toward it.
- **Recommendation**: **adopt now**. Use the lexical capability snapshot as a routing signal for query policy and benchmark segmentation.
- **Affected repo area**: `mcp_server/lib/search/sqlite-fts.ts`, `mcp_server/handlers/memory-search.ts`
- **Risk**: Minimal implementation risk; the main risk is adding policy branches without enough eval coverage.

## Assessment
- New information ratio: **0.44**
- Strongest conclusion: Public should not choose between semantic and lexical globally. It should route between them by query shape:
  - Semantic-first for paraphrase, abstraction, and multi-facet questions
  - Lexical-first for exact identifiers, titles, trigger phrases, file paths, and stable team vocabulary
  - Hybrid late fusion for everything ambiguous or mixed
- Validation: `bash .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/spec/validate.sh "/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/003-modus-memory-main" --strict` returned `RESULT: PASSED` with the read-only sandbox warning `cannot create temp file for here document: Operation not permitted`.
- This was a read-only iteration. I verified source evidence and phase validation, but did not update phase artifacts.

## Recommended Next Focus
Run a narrow routing experiment instead of a retrieval rewrite: detect exact/token-heavy queries, send them through a lexical-first fast lane with optional early exit, keep abstraction/paraphrase queries on semantic-first hybrid, and measure both recall@20 and latency by bucket. The key follow-on is not “make lexical stronger everywhere,” but “make lexical win only when the query shape says it should.”

RESEARCH BRIEF:
# $refine TIDD-EC Prompt: 003-modus-memory-main

## 2. Role

You are a research specialist in spaced repetition memory systems, BM25 search ranking, cross-referenced knowledge graphs, MCP-exposed local memory services, and local-first personal memory architectures. Work like a systems analyst who can trace implementation details from source code, separate README claims from verified mechanics, and translate Modus Memory's specific design choices into concrete improvements for `Code_Environment/Public`.

## 3. Task

Research Modus Memory's FSRS spaced repetition, BM25 search ranking, and cross-referencing patterns to identify practical, evidence-backed improvements for `Code_Environment/Public`'s memory search and retrieval, especially around memory decay and reinforcement, query expansion, knowledge linking, and plain-markdown memory storage patterns. Determine which ideas should be `adopt now`, `prototype later`, or `reject`.

## 4. Context

### 4.1 System Description

Modus Memory is a local memory server that stores data as plain markdown files, exposes MCP tools, uses BM25 with field boosting, layers a tiered query cache over lexical retrieval, applies FSRS-style spaced repetition with decay and reinforcement, builds cross-references from subjects, tags, and entities, and uses a librarian query expander to widen lexical recall without relying on vectors. The core attraction is a lightweight local binary, markdown-native persistence, and search behavior that mixes ranking, recency, and linked context while staying git-friendly and human-readable.

### 4.2 Cross-Phase Awareness Table

| Phase | System | Core Pattern | Overlap Risk | Differentiation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 001 | Engram | MCP memory server (Go, SQLite+FTS5) | 003 (MCP memory) | Focus tool profiles, session lifecycle, topic keys |
| 002 | Mex | Markdown scaffold + drift detection | 003 (markdown storage) | Focus drift detection, scaffold structure |
| 003 | Modus Memory | FSRS spaced repetition + BM25 | 001 (FTS5), 004 (local memory) | Focus FSRS decay, cross-referencing, librarian expansion |
| 004 | OpenCode Mnemosyne | Hybrid search (FTS5 + vector) | 003 (local memory) | Focus vector search, plugin architecture |

### 4.3 What This Repo Already Has

`Code_Environment/Public` already has Spec Kit Memory with semantic and hybrid retrieval, markdown-backed memory artifacts, importance tiers, and an FSRS-based classification-decay layer in the MCP server. It does **not** currently mirror Modus Memory's end-to-end local vault server model, BM25 field-boosted lexical search with lightweight query caching, librarian-style synonym expansion for keyword retrieval, or simple subject/tag/entity adjacency maps that surface connected documents directly in result sets. Base the comparison on current code, not stale assumptions.

## 5. Instructions

1. Treat `/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/003-modus-memory-main` as the pre-approved phase folder. Skip Gate 3, keep all writes inside this phase folder, and treat everything under `external/` as read-only.
2. Start with the lexical search implementation: read `external/modus-memory-main/internal/index/bm25.go`, `external/modus-memory-main/internal/index/cache.go`, and `external/modus-memory-main/internal/librarian/search.go` before anything else. Trace tokenization, stemming, field weights, prefix matching, Jaccard cache reuse, and query expansion order.
3. After the ranking path, read `external/modus-memory-main/internal/index/indexer.go` if needed to confirm how documents are loaded into the search engine and how search results are assembled. Keep focus on ranking behavior, not generic indexing boilerplate.
4. Next, trace FSRS and memory-fact behavior by reading `external/modus-memory-main/internal/vault/facts.go` and `external/modus-memory-main/internal/index/facts.go`. Extract the exact stability, difficulty, confidence, floor, access-count, and reinforcement mechanics. Do not collapse these into a generic "TTL" description.
5. After FSRS, inspect cross-referencing by reading `external/modus-memory-main/internal/index/crossref.go`. Trace how subject, tag, and entity adjacency maps are built, what weighting is used for connected results, and what the system deliberately does **not** do because it avoids a full graph database.
6. Read `external/modus-memory-main/internal/markdown/parser.go` and `external/modus-memory-main/internal/markdown/writer.go` after the retrieval core. Study frontmatter parsing, body parsing, wiki-link extraction, markdown write conventions, and how plain-file storage shapes operability and portability.
7. Read MCP tool handlers next: `external/modus-memory-main/internal/mcp/vault.go` and `external/modus-memory-main/internal/mcp/memory.go`. Trace which tools are free vs. Pro, where librarian expansion is invoked, where cross-reference hints are appended, and where reinforcement happens automatically on search recall.
8. Read `/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/003-modus-memory-main/external/modus-memory-main/README.md` only after the source files above. Use it to validate claims about cached search speed, markdown-native persistence, binary size, MCP surface area, and the intended value proposition. Do not let README marketing copy override code evidence.
9. Compare Modus directly against current `Code_Environment/Public` memory behavior by reading `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/handlers/memory-search.ts`, `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/lib/search/fsrs.ts`, and `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/lib/cognitive/fsrs-scheduler.ts`. Be explicit about what this repo already does with FSRS-style decay and where Modus still differs materially.
10. Separate overlap cleanly across phases: avoid redoing `001` as a generic MCP memory-server study, avoid drifting into `002` markdown-scaffold and drift-detection patterns, and avoid reframing `003` as vector or plugin work owned by `004`. This phase owns BM25, lightweight caching, librarian expansion, FSRS reinforcement loops, and adjacency-map cross-references.
11. Before any deep-research run, ensure this phase folder contains the required Spec Kit docs for the research effort. If they are missing, note the gap and create or request them through the established spec workflow before claiming the phase is complete.
12. Validate the phase folder before deep research with:
    ```bash
    cd /Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public && bash .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/spec/validate.sh "/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/003-modus-memory-main" --strict
    ```
13. After validation passes, run deep research against this same phase folder using this exact topic:
    ```text
    Research the external repository at /Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/003-modus-memory-main/external/modus-memory-main and identify concrete improvements for Code_Environment/Public, especially around spaced repetition memory decay, BM25 search ranking, query expansion, cross-referencing, and plain-markdown memory storage patterns.
    ```
14. Save all outputs inside this phase folder, especially under `research/`. Every meaningful finding must cite exact file paths, explain what Modus does, why it matters here, whether to `adopt now`, `prototype later`, or `reject`, what Public subsystem it affects, and what migration, compatibility, or validation risk comes with it.
15. When research is complete, update `checklist.md`, create `implementation-summary.md`, and save memory with:
    ```bash
    cd /Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public && node .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/dist/memory/generate-context.js "/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/003-modus-memory-main"
    ```

## 6. Research Questions

1. How exactly does Modus implement BM25 scoring across path, source, subject, title, tags, and body, and which field-weight choices are likely to transfer well to `Code_Environment/Public`?
2. How much of Modus's search speed story comes from BM25 itself versus the tiered cache, prefix fallback, tokenization rules, and result deduplication?
3. How does librarian query expansion work in practice: what expansions are requested, how many variants are kept, how are duplicates merged, and what failure fallbacks exist?
4. What is the precise FSRS model in `internal/vault/facts.go`: initial stability by importance, memory-type difficulty modifiers, decay floor behavior, reinforcement growth, and access-count tracking?
5. How does automatic reinforcement on `memory_search` differ from explicit reinforcement tools, and what recall event model would make sense for Spec Kit Memory?
6. How does Modus's simple in-memory fact search interact with markdown-backed fact files, and what can be learned from that split between vault-wide search and fact-specific retrieval?
7. How are subject, tag, and entity cross-references represented, weighted, and surfaced, and where does the adjacency-map approach outperform or underperform richer causal or graph-based linking?
8. How does the markdown parser and writer shape operability: frontmatter fields, wiki links, body handling, file naming, duplicate avoidance, and human-editability?
9. Compared with Spec Kit Memory's current hybrid and FSRS-aware retrieval stack, which Modus ideas are genuinely missing, which are partial overlaps, and which would be redundant?
10. Which Modus patterns would best improve query-time recall in `Code_Environment/Public`: BM25 field boosts, query caching, lexical expansion, connected-result hints, or simpler markdown-vault ergonomics?
11. How credible are the README performance claims given the code structure, and what should be treated as a benchmark candidate versus an unverified marketing number?

## 7. Do's

- Do trace the FSRS algorithm in detail, including stability, difficulty, retrievability, confidence floors, and reinforcement updates.
- Do inspect the exact BM25 field weights, tokenization behavior, prefix-match fallback, and query-cache thresholds.
- Do study librarian query expansion as a lexical-recall layer, not as a generic "AI enhancement" feature.
- Do inspect the cross-referencing data model based on subject, tag, and entity adjacency maps.
- Do examine the markdown file format, write conventions, and duplicate-handling logic because plain-file operability is a core design choice.
- Do compare Modus against the current Spec Kit Memory code so recommendations distinguish overlap from net-new value.
- Do benchmark or at least critically assess performance claims where the code gives enough evidence to reason about likely bottlenecks.

## 8. Don'ts

- Do not focus on installation, packaging, Homebrew distribution, or release mechanics.
- Do not confuse FSRS spaced repetition with simple TTL expiry, stale-after-N-days logic, or a one-shot archive rule.
- Do not ignore the markdown storage format; git-friendly, human-readable persistence is part of the architecture, not just implementation detail.
- Do not quote README claims as proven if the source code does not validate them.
- Do not recommend replacing `Code_Environment/Public`'s semantic or hybrid retrieval with BM25 alone unless the evidence clearly supports that tradeoff.
- Do not describe this repo as lacking all FSRS or decay logic when current code already contains an FSRS-based scheduler and classification-decay path.
- Do not blur Modus's lightweight adjacency maps with existing causal-memory or code-graph capabilities; compare them precisely.
- Do not edit anything under `external/` or outside this phase folder.

## 9. Examples

### Example A: FSRS reinforcement finding

`internal/vault/facts.go` reinforces memories automatically when `memory_search` returns them, increasing stability, slightly lowering difficulty, updating `last_accessed`, and incrementing `access_count`. A strong finding would explain how that recall loop differs from Spec Kit Memory's current FSRS-aware decay layer, identify where automatic reinforcement could improve real-world memory freshness in `Code_Environment/Public`, and classify the idea as `adopt now`, `prototype later`, or `reject`.

### Example B: Librarian expansion finding

`internal/librarian/search.go` expands a natural-language query into 3-5 keyword-oriented variants, preserves the original query, caps the variant set, and falls back cleanly if parsing fails. A strong finding would explain how that lexical expansion could complement rather than replace current semantic retrieval in `Code_Environment/Public`, what guardrails are needed to prevent noisy recall, and whether the pattern should be adopted directly or only prototyped.

## 10. Constraints

### 10.1 Error handling

- If a cited file is missing or diverges from README claims, say so plainly instead of guessing.
- If the code and README disagree, prefer code evidence and mark the README statement as unverified or outdated.
- If comparison assumptions about `Code_Environment/Public` prove false, correct them in the research rather than preserving stale framing.
- If a performance claim cannot be reproduced from static analysis, label it as a claim to benchmark later, not an established fact.

### 10.2 Scope

**IN SCOPE**

- BM25 scoring, tokenization, stemming, field boosting, prefix fallback, and cache behavior
- librarian query expansion and result merging
- FSRS decay, reinforcement, floors, stability, difficulty, retrievability, and recall triggers
- subject, tag, and entity cross-referencing
- markdown file structure, parser/writer behavior, and vault ergonomics
- MCP tool handlers that expose search, memory, reinforcement, decay, and connected-doc surfaces
- comparison against current Spec Kit Memory retrieval and decay capabilities

**OUT OF SCOPE**

- installer UX, packaging, licensing strategy, or release engineering
- generic MCP primers unrelated to Modus's implementation choices
- vector search or embedding architecture except when explicitly contrasting with phase `004`
- markdown drift detection patterns primarily owned by phase `002`
- broad memory-server taxonomy that does not produce implementation-level recommendations

### 10.3 Prioritization framework

Rank findings in this order: improvement to retrieval quality in `Code_Environment/Public`, complementarity with existing hybrid retrieval instead of duplication, operational simplicity of implementation, markdown-native maintainability, quality of evidence in source code, and clarity of differentiation from phases `001`, `002`, and `004`.

## 11. Deliverables

- `phase-research-prompt.md` present and tailored to `003-modus-memory-main`
- `research/research.md` as the canonical report with at least 5 evidence-backed findings
- explicit comparison to current Public retrieval, FSRS decay, and memory-linking behavior
- clear classification of each recommendation as `adopt now`, `prototype later`, or `reject`
- `implementation-summary.md` created at the end
- memory saved from this phase folder using `generate-context.js`

Minimum finding schema:

- finding title
- exact source evidence
- what Modus Memory does
- why it matters for `Code_Environment/Public`
- recommendation: `adopt now`, `prototype later`, or `reject`
- affected repo area
- migration, compatibility, or validation risk

## 12. Evaluation Criteria

- CLEAR target: `>= 40/50`
- RICCE compliance is visible in the prompt:
  - **Role** is specialized in spaced repetition, BM25, cross-references, and local-first memory systems
  - **Instructions** are ordered, concrete, and path-specific
  - **Context** is domain-specific, cross-phase aware, and honest about current repo overlap
  - **Constraints** limit scope and define evidence handling
  - **Examples** show what strong Modus-derived findings look like
- at least 5 findings are backed by code evidence rather than README-only assertions
- findings distinguish overlap with current Spec Kit Memory from genuinely new value
- overlap with `001` and `004` is explicitly addressed so recommendations are not duplicated or misplaced
- markdown storage, BM25 ranking, FSRS reinforcement, and cross-reference mechanics are all covered directly

## 13. Completion Bar

The phase is only complete when all of the following are true:

- the reading order started with ranking and search files, then FSRS, then cross-references, then MCP handlers, then README validation
- current `Code_Environment/Public` FSRS and retrieval behavior was compared using code, not assumptions
- the validation command passed on this exact phase folder
- `research/research.md` contains at least 5 evidence-backed findings
- each finding is tagged `adopt now`, `prototype later`, or `reject`
- `checklist.md` is updated with evidence and completion marks
- `implementation-summary.md` exists
- memory is saved successfully for `003-modus-memory-main`
- no edits were made outside the phase folder
- cross-phase overlap with `001` and `004` is explicitly resolved

I’m treating this as a read-only iteration focused on DX patterns in the external Modus code and how they compare to Spec Kit Memory. I’ll do a quick memory pass for prior context, then inspect the relevant source files in the prescribed order, verify the current Public behavior, and synthesize iteration 27 in the exact format you asked for.

# Autonomous Deep Research Loop

Iterative research protocol with fresh context per iteration, externalized state, and convergence detection for deep technical investigation.

Runtime path resolution:
- OpenCode/Copilot runtime: `.opencode/agent/*.md`
- Claude runtime: `.claude/agents/*.md`
- Codex runtime: `.codex/agents/*.toml`

<!-- ANCHOR:when-to-use -->
## 1. WHEN TO USE

### When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Deep investigation requiring multiple rounds of discovery
- Topic spans 3+ technical domains or sources
- Initial findings need progressive refinement
- Overnight or unattended research sessions
- Research where prior findings inform subsequent queries

### When NOT to Use

- Simple, single-question research (use direct codebase search or `/spec_kit:plan`)
- Known-solution documentation (use `/spec_kit:plan`)
- Implementation tasks (use `/spec_kit:implement`)
- Quick codebase searches (use `@context` or direct Grep/Glob)
- Fewer than 3 sources needed (single-pass research suffices)

### Keyword Triggers

`autoresearch`, `deep research`, `autonomous research`, `research loop`, `iterative research`, `multi-round research`, `deep investigation`, `comprehensive research`

For iterative code review and quality auditing, see `sk-deep-review`.

### Lifecycle Contract

Live lifecycle branches:
- `resume` — continue the active lineage
- `restart` — start a new generation with explicit parent linkage
- `fork` — branch from the current packet state
- `completed-continue` — reopen a completed lineage only after immutable synthesis snapshotting

## 2. SMART ROUTING

### Resource Loading Levels

| Level | When to Load | Resources |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| ALWAYS | Every skill invocation | Quick reference baseline |
| CONDITIONAL | If intent signals match | Loop protocol, convergence, state format |
| ON_DEMAND | Only on explicit request | Templates, detailed specifications |

### Smart Router Pseudocode

    "ON_DEMAND": ["references/loop_protocol.md", "references/state_format.md", "references/convergence.md"],
}
```

### Scoped Guard

```python
def _guard_in_skill():
    """Verify this skill is active before loading resources."""
    if not hasattr(_guard_in_skill, '_active'):
        _guard_in_skill._active = True
    return _guard_in_skill._active

def discover_markdown_resources(base_path: Path) -> list[str]:
    """Discover all .md files in the assets directory."""
    return sorted(str(p.relative_to(base_path)) for p in (base_path / "references").glob("*.md"))
```

### Phase Detection

Detect the current research phase from dispatch context to load appropriate resources:

| Phase | Signal | Resources to Load |
|-------|--------|-------------------|
| Init | No JSONL exists | Loop protocol, state format |
| Iteration | Dispatch context includes iteration number | Loop protocol, convergence |
| Stuck | Dispatch context includes "RECOVERY" | Convergence, loop protocol |
| Synthesis | Convergence triggered STOP | Quick reference |

### Core Innovation: Fresh Context Per Iteration

Each agent dispatch gets a fresh context window. State continuity comes from files, not memory. This solves context degradation in long research sessions.

Adapted from: karpathy/autoresearch (loop concept), AGR (fresh context "Ralph Loop"), pi-autoresearch (JSONL state), autoresearch-opencode (context injection).

### Data Flow

```
Init --> Create config.json, strategy.md, state.jsonl
  |
Loop --> Read state --> Check convergence --> Dispatch @deep-research
  |                                              |
  |                                              v
  |                                         Agent executes:
  |                                         1. Read state files
  |                                         2. Determine focus
  |                                         3. Research (3-5 actions)
  |                                         4. Write iteration-NNN.md
  |                                         5. Update strategy.md
  |                                         6. Append state.jsonl
  |                                              |
  +<--- Evaluate results <-----------------------+
  |
  +--- Continue? --> Yes: next iteration
  |                  No: exit loop
  v
Synthesize --> Compile final research/research.md
  |
Save --> generate-context.js --> verify memory artifact
```

### Key Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Externalized state** | All research continuity via files, not agent memory |
| **Fresh context** | Each iteration gets a clean agent with no prior context |
| **Convergence** | Multi-signal detection: newInfoRatio, stuck count, questions answered |
| **Strategy file** | Reducer-synchronized research steering with machine-owned sections |
| **JSONL log** | Append-only structured log for lineage and iteration data |
| **Findings registry** | Reducer-owned open/resolved questions, key findings, and ruled-out directions |

# CocoIndex Code - Semantic Code Search via Vector Embeddings

Natural language code search through two complementary approaches: CLI (ccc) for speed and one-off queries, MCP server (1 tool: `search`) for AI agent integration via stdio transport.


<!-- ANCHOR:when-to-use -->
## 1. WHEN TO USE

### Activation Triggers

**Use when**:
- User asks to "find code that does X" or "search for implementations of Y"
- User needs to discover code by concept or intent rather than exact text
- User wants to find similar code patterns across the codebase
- Grep/Glob exact matching is insufficient and fuzzy or semantic matching is needed
- User mentions "semantic search", "code search", "find similar code"
- User needs to locate logic handling a specific concern (e.g., "where is the retry logic")
- User wants to understand how a concept is implemented across multiple files
- User asks "how is X implemented" or "what handles Y"
- User wants to understand architecture or module relationships
- Starting work on an unfamiliar part of the codebase (onboarding queries)
- @context agent is exploring code structure and needs concept-based discovery
- Any exploration task where the exact function/class name is unknown

**Automatic Triggers**:
- "semantic search", "find code that", "search for implementations"
- "similar code", "code that handles", "where is the logic for"
- "cocoindex", "ccc", "vector search"
- "find similar", "code search", "search codebase"
- "how is", "what handles", "where does", "understand the"
- "explore", "architecture", "module relationships"
- "onboarding", "unfamiliar code", "new to this"

### When NOT to Use

**Do not use for**:
- Exact text or regex search (use Grep instead)
- File name or path search (use Glob instead)
- Reading known files (use Read instead)
- The codebase has not been indexed yet (run `ccc index` first)
- Simple string matching where the exact token is known
- Non-code files (semantic search is optimized for source code)

## 3. HOW IT WORKS

### Two Approaches

CocoIndex Code provides two access patterns for semantic code search:

1. **CLI (ccc)** - Direct terminal usage, fastest for one-off searches
2. **MCP server** - AI agent integration via `ccc mcp` (stdio mode)

### CLI Approach (Primary) - CocoIndex Code CLI

#### Semantic Search

```bash
# Basic semantic search
ccc search "error handling middleware" --limit 5

# Filter by language
ccc search "database connection" --lang typescript

# Filter by path
ccc search "authentication" --path "src/**"

# Combine filters
ccc search "retry logic" --lang python --path "lib/**" --limit 10
```

#### Index Management

```bash
# Check index status
ccc status

# Build or update the index
ccc index

# Reset project databases (destructive)
ccc reset

I’ve loaded the research-loop and semantic-search guidance. I’m verifying the phase folder and strict validation once up front, then I’ll trace the ranking, FSRS, cross-reference, markdown, and MCP surfaces with a DX lens.

The first pass confirms a few promising DX areas already: Modus exposes explicit operational tools like `vault_status`, `memory_reinforce`, and `vault_connected`, and its search path logs its routing decisions. I’m now reading the exact implementations and doing one semantic search pass for setup/debug/status surfaces so the DX findings stay grounded in code rather than just retrieval internals.

I’ve got the core evidence now. One thing that stands out is the DX contrast: Modus has a compact, operator-facing control plane with explicit verbs and status surfaces, while Public has stronger internals but hides more of them behind metadata and logs. I’m doing one last pass through `lib/search/fsrs.ts`, `sqlite-fts.ts`, and the README claims so the recommendations cleanly separate “steal this DX pattern” from “we already have the underlying mechanics.”

    26	
    27	**modus-memory** is a personal memory server that runs on your machine, stores everything in plain markdown, and connects to any AI client via [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io).
    28	
    29	One binary. No cloud. No Docker. No database. Your memories stay on your disk as files you can read, edit, grep, and back up with git.
    30	
    31	> **Completely free. 19,000+ documents indexed in 2 seconds. Cached searches in <100 microseconds. 6MB binary, zero dependencies.**
    32	
    33	## Demo
    34	
    35	<p align="center">
    36	  <img src="assets/demo.svg" alt="modus-memory demo — install, store memory, recall weeks later" width="800"/>
    37	</p>
    38	
    39	Your AI remembers a decision you made 3 weeks ago — in a completely new chat. No copy-paste, no "here's my context dump." Just ask, and it knows.
    40	
    41	## Why
    42	
    43	Every AI conversation starts from zero. Your assistant forgets everything the moment the window closes.
    44	
    45	Cloud memory services charge $19–249/month to store your personal data on their servers. Open-source alternatives require Python, Docker, PostgreSQL, and an afternoon of setup. The official MCP memory server is deliberately minimal — no search ranking, no decay, no cross-referencing. Other "zero-infrastructure" tools still need Node.js runtimes and LLM API keys for every search.
    46	
    47	<p align="center">
    48	  <img src="assets/comparison.svg" alt="modus-memory vs cloud memory services" width="800"/>
    49	</p>
    50	
    51	**modus-memory** fills the gap:
    52	
    53	- **BM25 full-text search** with field boosting and query caching — 19K docs in <5ms
    54	- **FSRS spaced repetition** — memories decay naturally, strengthen on recall
    55	- **Cross-referencing** — facts, notes, and entities linked by subject and tag
    56	- **Librarian query expansion** — "React hooks" also finds "useState lifecycle"
    57	- **Plain markdown storage** — your data is always yours, always readable
    58	- **~6MB binary** — download, configure, done. No runtime, no interpreter, no container
    59	
    60	### Without memory vs. with memory
    61	
    62	| Scenario | Without | With modus-memory |
    63	|----------|---------|-------------------|
    64	| Start a new chat | AI knows nothing about you | AI recalls your preferences, past decisions, project context |
    65	| Switch AI clients | Start over completely | Same memory, any MCP client |
    66	| Ask "what did we decide about auth?" | Blank stare | Instant recall + linked context |
    67	| Close the window | Everything lost | Persisted to disk, searchable forever |
    68	| 6 months later | Stale memories clutter results | FSRS naturally fades noise, reinforces what matters |
    69	
    70	### Token savings
    71	
    72	Memory isn't just about remembering. It's a token reduction strategy.
    73	
    74	| Approach | Tokens per query | Cost at $3/1M tokens | Monthly (50 queries/day) |
    75	|----------|-----------------|----------------------|--------------------------|
    76	| Stuff 1K facts into context | ~36,000 | $0.109 | **$164** |
    77	| modus-memory search (top 10) | ~500 | $0.0015 | **$2.25** |
    78	
    79	**72x fewer input tokens.** Instead of cramming everything into the context window, modus-memory searches 19,000+ documents in <5ms and returns only what's relevant.

   170	### 2. Start remembering
   171	
   172	Your AI client now has 11 memory tools. Try:
   173	
   174	```
   175	"Remember that I prefer TypeScript over JavaScript for new projects"
   176	"What do you know about my coding preferences?"
   177	"Find everything related to the authentication refactor"
   178	```
   179	
   180	### 3. Check your vault
   181	
   182	```bash
   183	modus-memory health
   184	# modus-memory 0.3.0
   185	# Vault: ~/modus/vault
   186	# Documents: 847
   187	# Facts: 234 total, 230 active
   188	# Cross-refs: 156 subjects, 89 tags, 23 entities
   189	```
   190	
   191	## Tools
   192	
   193	modus-memory exposes 11 MCP tools — all free, no limits:
   194	
   195	| Tool | Description |
   196	|------|-------------|
   197	| `vault_search` | BM25 full-text search with librarian query expansion and cross-reference hints |
   198	| `vault_read` | Read any document by path |
   199	| `vault_write` | Write a document with YAML frontmatter + markdown body |
   200	| `vault_list` | List documents in a subdirectory with optional filters |
   201	| `vault_status` | Vault statistics — document counts, index size, cross-ref stats |
   202	| `memory_facts` | List memory facts, optionally filtered by subject |
   203	| `memory_search` | Search memory facts with automatic FSRS reinforcement on recall |
   204	| `memory_store` | Store a new memory fact (subject/predicate/value) |
   205	| `memory_reinforce` | Explicitly reinforce a memory — increases stability, decreases difficulty |
   206	| `memory_decay_facts` | Run FSRS decay sweep — naturally forgets stale memories |
   207	| `vault_connected` | Cross-reference query — find everything linked to a subject, tag, or entity |
   208	
   209	## The Librarian Pattern
   210	
   211	Most memory systems let any LLM read and write freely. modus-memory is designed around a different principle: a single dedicated local model — the **Librarian** — serves as the sole authority over persistent state.
   212	
   213	```
   214	┌─────────────┐     ┌────────────────┐     ┌──────────────┐
   215	│ Cloud Model  │◄───►│   Librarian    │◄───►│ modus-memory │
   216	│ (reasoning)  │     │ (local, ~8B)   │     │   (vault)    │
   217	└─────────────┘     └────────────────┘     └──────────────┘
   218	                     Sole write access
   219	                     Query expansion
   220	                     Relevance filtering
   221	                     Context compression
   222	```
   223	
   224	The cloud model stays focused on reasoning. The Librarian handles retrieval, filing, deduplication, decay, and context curation — then hands over only the 4-8k tokens that actually matter.
   225	
   226	- **Token discipline** — the Librarian compresses and reranks locally before anything touches the cloud. You pay for signal, not noise.
   227	- **Context hygiene** — the cloud model never sees duplicates, stale facts, or irrelevant memories.
   228	- **Privacy** — sensitive data stays on your machine. The Librarian decides what crosses the boundary.
   229	- **Consistency** — one model means consistent tagging, frontmatter, importance levels, and deduplication.
   230	
   231	Any small, instruction-following model works: Gemma 4, Qwen 3, Llama 3, Phi-4. It doesn't need to be smart. It needs to be reliable.
   232	
   233	**[Full guide: system prompt, model recommendations, example flows, and wiring patterns →](docs/librarian.md)**

   239	</p>
   240	
   241	### Storage
   242	
   243	Everything is a markdown file with YAML frontmatter:
   244	
   245	```markdown
   246	---
   247	subject: React
   248	predicate: preferred-framework
   249	source: user
   250	confidence: 0.9
   251	importance: high
   252	created: 2026-04-02T10:30:00Z
   253	---
   254	
   255	User prefers React with TypeScript for all frontend projects.
   256	Server components when possible, Tailwind for styling.
   257	```
   258	
   259	Files live in `~/vault/` (configurable). Back them up with git. Edit them in VS Code. Grep them from the terminal. They're just files.

I’m pulling one final comparison slice on configuration complexity. That should let me separate “Modus is actually simpler to operate” from “Modus just documents simplicity well.”

# Iteration 027: DEVELOPER EXPERIENCE

## Focus
DEVELOPER EXPERIENCE: How easy is this system to set up, configure, debug, and maintain? What DX patterns should we steal for our memory system?

## Findings
### Finding 1: Opinionated defaults make Modus dramatically easier to bootstrap than Public
- **Source**: [indexer.go](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/003-modus-memory-main/external/internal/index/indexer.go#L139); [indexer.go](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/003-modus-memory-main/external/internal/index/indexer.go#L145); [README.md](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/003-modus-memory-main/external/README.md#L118); [README.md](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/003-modus-memory-main/external/README.md#L394); [memory-search.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/handlers/memory-search.ts#L763); [memory-search.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/handlers/memory-search.ts#L683); [fsrs-scheduler.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/lib/cognitive/fsrs-scheduler.ts#L356); [fsrs-scheduler.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/lib/cognitive/fsrs-scheduler.ts#L412)
- **What it does**: Modus defaults to `~/modus/vault`, accepts a single `--vault` flag or `MODUS_VAULT_DIR`, and documents the same setup shape across clients. Public exposes a much richer system, but operation depends on embedding readiness plus multiple env-driven routing/decay switches.
- **Why it matters**: Modus is easier to install because the operator mental model is tiny: one binary, one vault path, one health surface. Public’s capability is higher, but its setup/debug burden is also much higher.
- **Recommendation**: **adopt now**. Keep Public’s internals, but ship a blessed “simple operator profile” with minimal knobs, default-safe behavior, and one canonical bootstrap recipe.
- **Impact**: **high**

### Finding 2: First-class status and debug tools are one of Modus’s best DX ideas
- **Source**: [memory.go](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/003-modus-memory-main/external/internal/mcp/memory.go#L7); [vault.go](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/003-modus-memory-main/external/internal/mcp/vault.go#L225); [vault.go](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/003-modus-memory-main/external/internal/mcp/vault.go#L901); [sqlite-fts.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/lib/search/sqlite-fts.ts#L92); [sqlite-fts.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/lib/search/sqlite-fts.ts#L208); [memory-search.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/handlers/memory-search.ts#L904)
- **What it does**: Modus exposes `vault_status` and `vault_connected` directly in the MCP surface. Public already computes useful diagnostics like `lexicalPath` and `fallbackState`, but those mostly appear as logs or response metadata rather than as an operator-first debugging surface.
- **Why it matters**: Debuggable systems reduce support load. “What path did search take?” and “What’s unhealthy right now?” should be answerable without reading logs or inspecting raw trace payloads.
- **Recommendation**: **adopt now**. Add a dedicated `memory_status` or `memory_debug_search` surface that reports embedding readiness, lexical capability, cache path, intent route, graph contribution, and fail-open reasons in one place.
- **Impact**: **high**

### Finding 3: Explicit maintenance verbs beat hidden background behavior
- **Source**: [vault.go](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/003-modus-memory-main/external/internal/mcp/vault.go#L856); [vault.go](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/003-modus-memory-main/external/internal/mcp/vault.go#L885); [vault.go](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/003-modus-memory-main/external/internal/mcp/vault.go#L619); [vault.go](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/003-modus-memory-main/external/internal/mcp/vault.go#L649); [fsrs-scheduler.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/lib/cognitive/fsrs-scheduler.ts#L197)
- **What it does**: Modus gives operators concrete verbs for decay, reinforce, weaken, archive, and trust-stage changes, and each tool returns a human-readable confirmation of what changed. Public has strong FSRS math internally, but less of that state transition is exposed as an explicit operator workflow.
- **Why it matters**: Maintenance is easier when operators can intentionally trigger and inspect state transitions instead of inferring them from passive access or hidden schedulers.
- **Recommendation**: **adopt now**. Public should expose explicit review/decay/preview tools on top of the existing FSRS machinery rather than keeping those controls mostly implicit.
- **Impact**: **high**

### Finding 4: Capability-aware fallback is good DX only when the route is visible
- **Source**: [librarian/search.go](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/003-modus-memory-main/external/internal/librarian/search.go#L29); [librarian/search.go](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/003-modus-memory-main/external/internal/librarian/search.go#L35); [vault.go](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/003-modus-memory-main/external/internal/mcp/vault.go#L28); [vault.go](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/003-modus-memory-main/external/internal/mcp/vault.go#L47); [sqlite-fts.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/lib/search/sqlite-fts.ts#L210); [memory-search.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/handlers/memory-search.ts#L676); [memory-search.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/handlers/memory-search.ts#L699)
- **What it does**: Modus cleanly falls back to the original query when librarian expansion is unavailable or unparsable. Public already has stronger fail-open behavior across FTS, intent routing, and community fallback, but much of that is visible only in stderr or trace metadata.
- **Why it matters**: Operators trust fallback only when they can tell what path actually ran and why.
- **Recommendation**: **adopt now**. Public should surface a compact route summary in debug profiles or status tools instead of keeping routing visibility mostly in logs.
- **Impact**: **medium**

### Finding 5: Markdown-native storage is excellent for debugging, but write-on-read is the wrong DX pattern to copy
- **Source**: [parser.go](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/003-modus-memory-main/external/internal/markdown/parser.go#L98); [parser.go](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/003-modus-memory-main/external/internal/markdown/parser.go#L143); [writer.go](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/003-modus-memory-main/external/internal/markdown/writer.go#L10); [vault.go](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/003-modus-memory-main/external/internal/mcp/vault.go#L311); [facts.go](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/003-modus-memory-main/external/internal/vault/facts.go#L160)
- **What it does**: Modus stores state in plain markdown with tolerant parsing and simple rewrites, which is great for grep, git, and manual repair. But `memory_search` also treats every returned fact as a recall event and asynchronously mutates files on search.
- **Why it matters**: The file transparency is a genuine DX advantage. The automatic mutation-on-read is not: it makes debugging, reproducibility, and git diffs noisier, especially when search is supposed to be observational.
- **Recommendation**: **reject** direct write-on-read behavior. Steal the readable-file ergonomics and explicit mutation tools, not the automatic on-search file rewrite pattern.
- **Impact**: **medium**

### Finding 6: Modus’s small curated tool bundle is easier to learn than Public’s broad surface
- **Source**: [memory.go](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/003-modus-memory-main/external/internal/mcp/memory.go#L7); [README.md](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/003-modus-memory-main/external/README.md#L191); [memory-search.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/handlers/memory-search.ts#L482)
- **What it does**: Modus deliberately narrows its memory-facing MCP surface to 11 tools. Public’s surface is more capable, but also harder for operators and AI clients to learn quickly.
- **Why it matters**: Discoverability is part of DX. A smaller “operator bundle” can make a powerful system feel approachable without removing advanced capabilities.
- **Recommendation**: **prototype later**. Keep Public’s full surface, but add a curated operator profile or alias bundle centered on search, status, review, debug, health, and adjacency.
- **Impact**: **medium**

## Assessment
- New information ratio: **0.38**
- Strict validation on the phase folder returned `RESULT: PASSED` with the same read-only temp-file warning from `validate.sh`.
- This was a read-only iteration; I verified source evidence and current Public behavior, but did not update `research/research.md` or other phase artifacts.

## Recommended Next Focus
Run the next iteration on **operator workflow design**: map Public’s existing internals into a compact DX control plane with 3 concrete candidates only, `memory_status`, `memory_debug_search`, and `memory_review`, then judge whether each should be a new tool, a `profile:"debug"` response, or a wrapper around existing tools.

- **Why it matters**: Operators trust fallback only when they can tell what path actually ran and why.
- **Recommendation**: **adopt now**. Public should surface a compact route summary in debug profiles or status tools instead of keeping routing visibility mostly in logs.
- **Impact**: **medium**

### Finding 5: Markdown-native storage is excellent for debugging, but write-on-read is the wrong DX pattern to copy
- **Source**: [parser.go](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/003-modus-memory-main/external/internal/markdown/parser.go#L98); [parser.go](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/003-modus-memory-main/external/internal/markdown/parser.go#L143); [writer.go](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/003-modus-memory-main/external/internal/markdown/writer.go#L10); [vault.go](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/003-modus-memory-main/external/internal/mcp/vault.go#L311); [facts.go](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/003-modus-memory-main/external/internal/vault/facts.go#L160)
- **What it does**: Modus stores state in plain markdown with tolerant parsing and simple rewrites, which is great for grep, git, and manual repair. But `memory_search` also treats every returned fact as a recall event and asynchronously mutates files on search.
- **Why it matters**: The file transparency is a genuine DX advantage. The automatic mutation-on-read is not: it makes debugging, reproducibility, and git diffs noisier, especially when search is supposed to be observational.
- **Recommendation**: **reject** direct write-on-read behavior. Steal the readable-file ergonomics and explicit mutation tools, not the automatic on-search file rewrite pattern.
- **Impact**: **medium**

### Finding 6: Modus’s small curated tool bundle is easier to learn than Public’s broad surface
- **Source**: [memory.go](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/003-modus-memory-main/external/internal/mcp/memory.go#L7); [README.md](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/003-modus-memory-main/external/README.md#L191); [memory-search.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/handlers/memory-search.ts#L482)
- **What it does**: Modus deliberately narrows its memory-facing MCP surface to 11 tools. Public’s surface is more capable, but also harder for operators and AI clients to learn quickly.
- **Why it matters**: Discoverability is part of DX. A smaller “operator bundle” can make a powerful system feel approachable without removing advanced capabilities.
- **Recommendation**: **prototype later**. Keep Public’s full surface, but add a curated operator profile or alias bundle centered on search, status, review, debug, health, and adjacency.
- **Impact**: **medium**

## Assessment
- New information ratio: **0.38**
- Strict validation on the phase folder returned `RESULT: PASSED` with the same read-only temp-file warning from `validate.sh`.
- This was a read-only iteration; I verified source evidence and current Public behavior, but did not update `research/research.md` or other phase artifacts.

## Recommended Next Focus
Run the next iteration on **operator workflow design**: map Public’s existing internals into a compact DX control plane with 3 concrete candidates only, `memory_status`, `memory_debug_search`, and `memory_review`, then judge whether each should be a new tool, a `profile:"debug"` response, or a wrapper around existing tools.
