ACCUMULATED FINDINGS SUMMARY:
0.10
- Repo note: `external/AGENTS.md` exists, `research/research.md` is an appended multi-pass file whose cleanest current verdict is the final synthesis block near the end, and there is no persisted `iteration-030.md`.
- Operational note: strict validation returned `PASSED`, but also emitted a temp-file warning under the read-only sandbox; I could not update the phase files, create `implementation-summary.md`, or run the phase memory save.

## Recommended Next Focus
Implement the three `adopt now` items first in this order: compaction-time JSON-primary checkpoint, bootstrap memory-protocol hints, and audit/repair surfaces. After that, prototype selective verbatim evidence retention, a wake-up retrieval profile, and a citation-governed temporal fact sidecar; keep forced blocking saves, AAAK-first recall, and full palace taxonomy out of the near-term roadmap.

### Finding N: [Title]

## Assessment
- **New information ratio**: 0.12
- **Questions addressed**: phased sequencing, dependency ordering, what to keep out of the roadmap
- **Questions answered**: Q1 should be deterministic preservation plus protocol plus observability; Q2 should stay scoped to evidence retention and wake-up retrieval; Q3 should isolate temporal facts as a sidecar
- **Novelty justification**: This pass adds delivery sequencing and dependency structure on top of the settled 30-iteration recommendation set rather than introducing new primitives.
- **Operational note**: strict validation passed for the phase folder, but the validator reported a temp-file warning under the read-only sandbox, and I could not write this draft back to `research/research.md` or create the missing spec artifacts.

## Ruled Out
- Forced hook-blocking saves as the primary preservation mechanism because they interrupt the runtime without guaranteeing high-quality capture.
- AAAK-first recall because the repo’s own April 7, 2026 correction and benchmark notes mark it as lossy and worse than raw mode.
- Full palace taxonomy as core Public architecture because the practical value is in disciplined filters and hints, not the metaphor itself.

## Reflection
- **What worked**: Using the final synthesis block in [research.md#L290535](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/research/research.md#L290535) as the base and then re-checking the underlying source lines made the roadmap stable and low-drift.
- **What did not work**: The phase folder is not actually in the Level 3-on-disk state described by the prompt, so I could not turn this into a persisted packet update in this session.
- **What I would do differently**: Next pass should write this draft into `research/research.md`, update the checklist and implementation summary, and convert the roadmap into concrete follow-on implementation phases.

## Recommended Next Focus
Translate this roadmap into implementation packets: one Q1 packet for checkpointing and bootstrap hints, one Q1 packet for audit/repair surfaces, one Q2 packet for bounded verbatim evidence plus wake-up profile, and one Q3 packet for the temporal fact sidecar.

## Findings
For EACH finding:
### Finding N: [Title]
- **Novelty justification**: prior iterations identified what to adopt; this pass adds migration-specific breakage modes, rollout flags, and rollback mechanics grounded in current Public code.
- **Operational note**: the exact validator command returned `RESULT: PASSED`, but the packet currently infers as Level 1 and the checkout only contains [research/research.md](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/research/research.md#L1), not the expected Level 3 doc set. I could not persist iteration 32 because the sandbox is read-only.

## Ruled Out
- MemPalace-style hard blocking as the primary checkpoint mechanism, because it couples preservation to agent compliance.
- A second standalone bootstrap authority, because Public already has `session_bootstrap`, `session_resume`, and startup instructions.
- Raw repair or import flows that bypass `memory_health`, because Public’s current repair contract is bounded and confirmation-gated.

## Reflection
- **What worked**: anchoring on the final synthesis block first, then validating each adopt-now item against current source lines, kept the migration matrix consistent with the packet’s existing direction.
- **What did not work**: the phase folder is not in the expected on-disk Level 3 state, and the read-only sandbox prevented updating `research/research.md`, `implementation-summary.md`, or memory artifacts.
- **What I would do differently**: next pass should be a write-enabled rollout packet that converts these three findings into implementation phases with explicit flags, metrics, and disable paths.

## Recommended Next Focus
Create one implementation packet per adopt-now item, with rollout order:
1. compaction checkpoint in advisory mode first,
2. bootstrap hint extension second,
3. audit/repair surfaces third.

Each packet should ship with a kill switch, a success metric, and a one-command rollback path before any wider enablement.

For EACH finding:
### Finding N: [Title]

## Assessment
- New information ratio: 0.23
- Questions addressed: unit-test shape, integration-test shape, compaction-survival verification, memory-quality regression design, hygiene/temporal invariants, CI lane split
- Questions answered: fast unit coverage should stay fixture-backed and local; integration should prove save/restore/compaction continuity; regression testing should use seeded facts plus thresholds and existing eval channels, not only API-shape assertions
- Novelty justification: prior iterations identified what to adopt, but this pass adds the concrete verification architecture, dataset strategy, and CI split needed to ship those ideas safely

## Ruled Out
- One monolithic end-to-end suite that tries to prove correctness, scale, compaction survival, and quality in a single run
- Pure LLM-judged memory-quality tests without planted answers or numeric baselines
- Putting scale or ablation benchmarks into every default CI run
- Treating repair and invalidation features as “best effort” behavior without invariant tests

## Reflection
- What worked: reading the external test suite before the benchmark docs made the testing strategy concrete instead of speculative, and cross-checking against existing Public Vitest coverage showed we already have most of the harness primitives
- What did not work: the sandbox is read-only, so I could not append iteration 33 into [research.md](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/research/research.md) or update packet artifacts
- What I would do differently: next write-enabled pass should convert this directly into a test matrix section with named suites, thresholds, fixture locations, and CI/nightly ownership

## Recommended Next Focus
Define the exact thresholds and datasets for the adopted-pattern rollout: recall@5 and recall@10 floors, acceptable ablation deltas, wake-up token cap, compaction-survival assertions, and which checks run on PRs versus nightly.

## Findings
For EACH finding:
### Finding N: [Title]
- **Questions addressed**: search latency, storage growth, indexing overhead, startup time impact
- **Questions answered**: MemPalace’s direct semantic search is cheap; its wake-up/status/graph helpers become collection-scan heavy; hook-based preservation introduces visible latency and duplicate-cleanup debt; raw storage shifts cost from extraction to storage and maintenance; Public’s heavier startup is a deliberate trade for safer steady-state behavior
- **Novelty justification**: This pass adds an explicit cost model for the already-ranked architecture decisions by showing exactly where MemPalace pushes work into blocking hooks and full-collection scans, and where Public already absorbs comparable cost in safer startup/index phases.

## Ruled Out
- Full raw-verbatim-by-default adoption for Public, because the storage-growth and repair/dedup burden is too high for the marginal retrieval win over our current selective save path.
- Hook-blocking as the primary preservation mechanism, because it protects against compaction loss by injecting latency and duplicate risk into active sessions.
- AAAK or room-routing as the main performance lever, because the repo’s own corrected evidence shows token savings do not currently outweigh retrieval regressions and sidecar overhead.

## Reflection
- **What worked**: Reading the performance-critical source paths in order from search/wake-up to hooks/repair/startup made the trade-offs concrete instead of speculative.
- **What did not work**: The CocoIndex MCP search kept cancelling in this session, so I had to rely on direct file reads; the phase folder also still infers as Level 1, and strict validation passed with a temp-file warning under the read-only sandbox.
- **What I would do differently**: In a write-enabled pass, I would append this iteration into `research/research.md` and add one small benchmark matrix for Public: startup budget, p95 `memory_search`, storage growth per save, and compaction checkpoint cost.

## Recommended Next Focus
Turn these trade-offs into rollout budgets for Public:
1. Set explicit p95 latency targets for `session_bootstrap`, `memory_search`, and trigger matching.
2. Define storage-growth thresholds comparing JSON-primary saves versus any verbatim sidecar prototype.
3. Benchmark startup cost with and without BM25 rebuild, background scan, and cognitive modules.
4. If a temporal fact sidecar is explored, measure lookup latency and write amplification separately from the main memory index.

For EACH finding:
### Finding N: [Title]

## Assessment
- **New information ratio**: 0.18
- **Questions addressed**: taxonomy vs code-graph/CocoIndex; protocol bootstrap vs existing MCP hints; hook saves vs JSON-primary authority; raw verbatim vs current hybrid retrieval; temporal KG fit
- **Questions answered**: taxonomy should not become a core routing surface; protocol hints are directly portable; blocking hooks conflict as-is; raw verbatim belongs in a bounded sidecar; temporal facts fit only as a separate non-authoritative store
- **Novelty justification**: Earlier passes settled what to adopt; this pass maps those choices onto the actual Public tool boundaries that would accept or reject them.
- **Operational note**: `external/AGENTS.md` exists, and the exact strict validator command returned `RESULT: PASSED`, but the phase still inferred as Level 1 and emitted the temp-file warning under the read-only sandbox, so I could not persist `iteration-035.md`, update `research/research.md`, or create closing artifacts.

## Ruled Out
- Reusing wing/room/tunnel semantics for code navigation, because Public already has stronger authorities for semantic and structural code retrieval.
- MemPalace-style blocking save hooks as the primary preservation mechanism, because they conflict with Public’s structured save contract.
- Treating benchmark claims about rooms or AAAK as compatibility evidence, because the repo itself narrows or corrects those claims.

## Reflection
- **What worked**: Comparing the same concern across paired files, external source on one side and Public runtime files on the other, made compatibility boundaries much clearer than repo-level summaries.
- **What did not work**: CocoIndex MCP search cancelled again in this session, so this iteration had to rely on direct reads and grep-based source tracing.
- **What I would do differently**: The next write-enabled pass should turn this into an explicit authority matrix: which surface owns bootstrap, which owns save, which owns structural lookup, and which sidecars are allowed.

## Recommended Next Focus
Define the implementation authority contract for the three surviving ideas: bootstrap protocol hints, bounded verbatim evidence retention, and a temporal-fact sidecar, with explicit “must not compete with `code_graph_query`, CocoIndex, or JSON-primary `generate-context.js`” rules.

RESEARCH BRIEF:
# $refine TIDD-EC Prompt: 005-mempalace

## 2. Role

You are a research specialist in verbatim AI memory systems, ChromaDB-based semantic retrieval, navigable memory taxonomies, wake-up context layering, MCP tool design, hook-driven persistence, and local temporal knowledge graphs. Work like a systems analyst who can separate README positioning from verified Python mechanics, trace how MemPalace composes mining, storage, retrieval, hooks, and protocol guidance, and translate those choices into practical improvements for `Code_Environment/Public`.

## 3. Task

Research MemPalace's raw-verbatim memory architecture, palace taxonomy, wake-up stack, MCP protocol/tooling, hook-driven save flow, and temporal knowledge-graph patterns to identify practical, evidence-backed improvements for `Code_Environment/Public`, especially around session continuity, compaction survival, memory hygiene, and agent-facing recall ergonomics. Determine which MemPalace ideas should be `adopt now`, `prototype later`, or `reject`. Keep the analysis honest about what is source-confirmed, what is README-documented, and what is benchmark-claim territory.

## 4. Context

### 4.1 System Description

MemPalace is a local Python memory system centered on a strong design claim: keep raw conversation and project text instead of extracting only summarized facts, then make that verbatim corpus searchable and navigable. The external repo exposes a CLI, an MCP server, hook scripts, a ChromaDB-backed drawer store, a wake-up layering system, and a separate SQLite temporal knowledge graph. Its storage model uses palace terminology: wings for people/projects/topics, halls for shared memory categories, rooms for named ideas, closets for compact summaries, and drawers for original verbatim content.

The most important architectural tension in this phase is that MemPalace mixes strong implementation ideas with aggressive README claims that the project itself partially corrects in its April 7, 2026 note. The raw-verbatim result is the standout claim; AAAK is explicitly experimental and lossy; contradiction detection is documented as incomplete; and some benchmark or rerank claims live more in docs than in source. This phase should reward the underlying architecture where the code supports it, but it must not let benchmark marketing or future-looking README language blur the evidence line.

The repo appears to support three ingestion shapes into one shared memory backend: project mining, conversation mining, and a general heuristic extraction mode. Retrieval then spans direct semantic search, wake-up text generation across L0-L3 layers, palace graph traversal via shared room metadata, and MCP tooling that teaches an operational memory protocol to the agent through the status response itself. Hook scripts add another layer: instead of a memory system that only responds to explicit search/save calls, MemPalace also tries to shape the timing of memory writes at stop and pre-compact boundaries.

### 4.2 Cross-Phase Awareness Table

| Phase | System | Core Pattern | Overlap Risk | Differentiation |
|-------|--------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|
| 001 | Engram | MCP memory server (Go, SQLite+FTS5) | 005 (memory server), 004 (session continuity) | Focus tool profiles, session lifecycle, topic keys |
| 002 | Mex | Markdown scaffold + drift detection | 005 (project knowledge) | Focus drift detection, scaffold structure, no-DB approach |
| 003 | Modus Memory | FSRS spaced repetition + BM25 | 005 (local memory) | Focus FSRS decay, BM25, librarian expansion, cross-references |
| 004 | OpenCode Mnemosyne | Hybrid search (FTS5 + vector) | 005 (compaction, hybrid retrieval claims) | Focus plugin architecture, project/global scoping, wrapper boundary |
| 005 | MemPalace | Raw verbatim storage + palace taxonomy + hooks + temporal KG | 001 (MCP memory), 004 (compaction/helping memory survive), 003 (local memory) | Focus raw-no-extraction posture, wake-up layers, hooks, palace structure, temporal KG |

### 4.3 What This Repo Already Has

`Code_Environment/Public` already has Spec Kit Memory with hybrid retrieval, `memory_search`, `memory_context`, `memory_match_triggers`, memory-save flows through `generate-context.js`, session/bootstrap handling in the memory MCP server, and compaction-oriented structural transport via `.opencode/plugins/spec-kit-compact-code-graph.js`. It also already has semantic code search via CocoIndex and structured graph context via Compact Code Graph.

What it does **not** currently have is a raw-verbatim-by-default memory posture comparable to MemPalace's drawer model, a first-class wing/hall/room taxonomy for agent memory navigation, a dedicated L0/L1/L2/L3 wake-up stack for context loading, MemPalace-style stop/pre-compact save hooks that actively block to force preservation, or a separate temporal entity-triple knowledge graph with explicit invalidation alongside the main memory store. The comparison should stay anchored to those gaps rather than repeating generic hybrid-RAG analysis already covered elsewhere.

## 5. Instructions

1. Treat `/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace` as the pre-approved phase folder. Skip Gate 3, keep all writes inside this phase folder, and treat everything under `external/` as read-only.
2. Read the governing Public repo `AGENTS.md` first. Then explicitly verify whether `external/AGENTS.md` exists. If it does not, note that absence as evidence about repo scope rather than inventing external workflow constraints.
3. Before deep research begins, ensure this phase folder contains Level 3 Spec Kit docs: `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`, `checklist.md`, and `decision-record.md`.
4. Use `@speckit` for markdown authoring when the runtime supports agent routing. If routing is unavailable, preserve existing Spec Kit Level 3 structure manually without creating side-channel docs outside the phase folder.
5. Start with `external/README.md`, but read it critically. Cover these sections in order: the April 7, 2026 correction note; Quick Start; How You Actually Use It; The Palace; wake-up / AAAK sections; MCP tools; benchmark sections. Capture both the architecture claims and the repo's own admitted overstatements.
6. Immediately after the README, read `external/pyproject.toml` and `external/mempalace/cli.py`. Confirm the actual runtime boundary, command surface, install assumptions, and the core flows for `init`, `mine`, `search`, `wake-up`, `status`, `repair`, and `compress`.
7. Trace the MCP surface end to end in `external/mempalace/mcp_server.py`. Focus on tool registration, read/write split, stderr logging behavior, `PALACE_PROTOCOL`, `AAAK_SPEC`, status bootstrap behavior, duplicate checking, graph tools, knowledge-graph tools, diary tools, and what the tool names imply about agent discipline.
8. Trace retrieval and context loading next in `external/mempalace/searcher.py` and `external/mempalace/layers.py`. Capture the raw ChromaDB query path, wing/room filtering, L0/L1/L2/L3 layering, wake-up token assumptions, and how much of that layering is implementation versus README framing.
9. Trace structural navigation next in `external/mempalace/palace_graph.py` and `external/mempalace/knowledge_graph.py`. Keep these separate in your notes: palace graph traversal is metadata-derived from ChromaDB rooms/halls/wings, while the knowledge graph is a separate SQLite temporal triple store with invalidation.
10. Trace ingestion behavior next. Read `external/mempalace/miner.py`, `external/mempalace/convo_miner.py`, `external/mempalace/general_extractor.py`, and `external/mempalace/onboarding.py`. Focus on chunking strategy, room detection, no-summary posture, heuristic extraction, onboarding assumptions, and whether the system truly keeps everything or selectively restructures it during ingest.
11. Read hook and benchmark artifacts after the implementation core: `external/hooks/README.md`, `external/hooks/mempal_save_hook.sh`, `external/hooks/mempal_precompact_hook.sh`, and `external/benchmarks/BENCHMARKS.md`. Treat these as crucial to the product story, but distinguish carefully between executable behavior, experimental behavior, and benchmark claims that require caution.
12. Compare MemPalace directly against current `Code_Environment/Public` code: `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/handlers/memory-search.ts`, `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/context-server.ts`, `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/dist/memory/generate-context.js`, and `.opencode/plugins/spec-kit-compact-code-graph.js`. Be explicit about what Public already covers better and what MemPalace still contributes.
13. Before the main research pass, validate the phase folder with this exact command:
    ```bash
    cd /Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public && bash .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/spec/validate.sh "/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace" --strict
    ```
14. After validation passes, run `spec_kit:deep-research` with this exact topic:
    ```text
    Research the external repository at /Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external and identify concrete improvements for Code_Environment/Public, especially around raw verbatim memory storage, palace taxonomy (wings/halls/rooms), wake-up context layering, MCP protocol/tool design, hook-driven save flows, and temporal knowledge-graph patterns.
    ```
15. Save all outputs inside `research/`, with `research/research.md` as the canonical report. Every meaningful finding must cite exact file paths, say whether the evidence is `source-confirmed`, `README-documented`, `benchmark-documented`, or mixed, explain why it matters for `Code_Environment/Public`, classify the recommendation as `adopt now`, `prototype later`, or `reject`, identify the affected subsystem, and note migration or truthfulness risk. When research is complete, update `checklist.md`, create `implementation-summary.md`, and save memory with:
    ```bash
    cd /Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public && node .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/dist/memory/generate-context.js "/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace"
    ```

## 6. Research Questions

1. What does MemPalace gain from its raw-verbatim "store everything, then make it findable" posture, and where would that improve or conflict with Spec Kit Memory's more selective save and retrieval model?
2. How useful is the wing / hall / room / closet / drawer taxonomy in practice: does it materially improve navigation and recall, or does it mostly reframe metadata filtering in memorable language?
3. How does the L0/L1/L2/L3 wake-up stack compare with Public's `session_bootstrap`, `memory_context`, and compaction-recovery flows, and what parts of the layering model are reusable here?
4. What does `mcp_server.py` gain by embedding `PALACE_PROTOCOL` and `AAAK_SPEC` directly in the status bootstrap, and could Public benefit from similarly direct memory-usage guidance without adding prompt clutter?
5. How effective are the stop-hook and pre-compact-hook patterns at protecting context before loss, and how do they compare to Public's existing compaction-oriented structural plugin and memory-save workflows?
6. What are the real architectural consequences of keeping the temporal knowledge graph separate from the drawer store, especially around invalidation, diary entries, and fact-vs-verbatim boundaries?
7. How much of MemPalace's benchmark story is supported directly by code in this repo, and which claims should remain benchmark candidates or doc-level references rather than implementation truths?
8. How do `miner.py`, `convo_miner.py`, and `general_extractor.py` balance "store everything" against chunking, heuristics, room assignment, and extraction side paths?
9. Which MemPalace ideas most improve compaction survival and startup continuity for future Public sessions: wake-up layers, hook timing, memory protocol bootstrapping, diary writing, or taxonomy-based narrowing?
10. Which MemPalace features are genuinely reusable architecture, and which are presentation choices, experimental layers, or hype-prone claims that Public should not copy?
11. How should AAAK be evaluated honestly: as a useful optional compression dialect, a still-unproven context-loading experiment, or mostly a distraction from the stronger raw-verbatim baseline?

## 7. Do's

- Do distinguish raw verbatim storage from AAAK compression; they are not the same feature and do not have the same evidence quality.
- Do separate palace graph traversal from the temporal knowledge graph; one is metadata-derived navigation and the other is explicit fact storage with validity windows.
- Do inspect the actual hook scripts, not just their README, so the analysis captures the precise blocking behavior before save and compaction.
- Do compare MemPalace's wake-up flow against current Public bootstrap and compaction behavior using real Public files.
- Do treat the April 7, 2026 correction note as important evidence about truthfulness boundaries and product honesty.
- Do analyze how status/bootstrap responses teach the agent what to do, not just what data they return.
- Do map strong findings to specific Public subsystems such as Spec Kit Memory retrieval, context bootstrap, save flows, or compaction handling.

## 8. Don'ts

- Do not describe MemPalace as "just ChromaDB search"; the repo's differentiators are raw-storage posture, wake-up layers, hooks, taxonomy, and KG split.
- Do not treat README benchmark numbers as fully source-proven implementation facts unless the repo actually exposes the relevant pipeline.
- Do not recommend copying AAAK or benchmark marketing language wholesale into Public planning.
- Do not collapse this phase into generic hybrid-RAG analysis already owned by earlier phases.
- Do not ignore the repo's admitted inaccuracies or unresolved claims; they are central to evaluating whether an idea is production-worthy.
- Do not overlook the difference between "AI remembers because storage exists" and "AI remembers because the protocol tells it when and how to use storage."
- Do not edit anything under `external/` or outside this phase folder.

## 9. Examples

### Example A: Wake-up and protocol finding

```text
**Finding: Status doubles as a behavior bootstrap, not just a health check**
- Source: external/mempalace/mcp_server.py; external/mempalace/layers.py
- Evidence type: source-confirmed
- What it does: `mempalace_status` returns palace overview data plus `PALACE_PROTOCOL` and `AAAK_SPEC`, while the wake-up stack separately loads L0/L1 context for cheap startup continuity.
- Why it matters: Public already has resume/bootstrap tooling, but it does not currently use one memory-facing status surface to teach concrete retrieval and save behavior this directly.
- Recommendation: prototype later
- Affected area: memory bootstrap UX, session recovery guidance, compaction recovery behavior
- Risk/cost: Medium; could add prompt noise or duplicate existing guidance if not scoped carefully
```

### Example B: Hook-driven preservation finding

```text
**Finding: Save timing is enforced by hooks, not left to agent initiative alone**
- Source: external/hooks/mempal_save_hook.sh; external/hooks/mempal_precompact_hook.sh; external/hooks/README.md
- Evidence type: source-confirmed + README-documented
- What it does: the stop hook blocks every N human exchanges and the pre-compact hook always blocks, forcing the agent to preserve key context before loss.
- Why it matters: Public has compaction-oriented structural transport, but it does not currently enforce a comparable memory-preservation checkpoint before context collapse.
- Recommendation: adopt now or prototype later, depending on runtime surface
- Affected area: memory save automation, compaction resilience, agent operating protocol
- Risk/cost: Medium; intrusive save prompts and duplicate writes need guardrails
```

## 10. Constraints

### 10.1 Error handling

- If a README or benchmark claim is not directly supported by source, label it clearly as documentation- or benchmark-level evidence rather than implementation fact.
- If MemPalace's docs contradict its code or its own April 2026 correction note, prefer source evidence and call out the contradiction explicitly.
- If comparison assumptions about current `Code_Environment/Public` behavior are outdated, correct them in the research instead of preserving stale framing.
- If the external repo structure differs from the paths named here, preserve the same analytical order and document the actual files used.

### 10.2 Scope

**IN SCOPE**

- raw verbatim storage and no-summary posture
- palace taxonomy: wings, halls, rooms, closets, drawers
- L0/L1/L2/L3 wake-up layering
- MCP server design, status bootstrap, protocol guidance, diary tools
- stop and pre-compact hook behavior
- temporal knowledge graph and invalidation model
- mining modes, chunking, heuristics, onboarding
- benchmark and README truthfulness boundaries
- comparison against current Public memory, bootstrap, save, and compaction flows

**OUT OF SCOPE**

- generic Python style commentary
- speculative cloud scaling or hosted-service redesigns
- broad vector-database taxonomy disconnected from MemPalace evidence
- re-litigating BM25/FSRS/plugin topics already owned by earlier phases
- editing or fixing MemPalace itself

### 10.3 Prioritization framework

Rank findings in this order: leverage for Public session continuity, compaction-survival value, truthfulness and evidence quality, fit with current Spec Kit Memory capabilities, operational simplicity, memory-hygiene impact, and clean differentiation from phases `001` through `004`.

## 11. Deliverables

- `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`, `checklist.md`, and `decision-record.md` present and valid before deep research starts
- `research/research.md` as the canonical report with at least 5 evidence-backed findings
- explicit comparison against current Public memory retrieval, bootstrap, save, and compaction behavior
- each finding labeled `adopt now`, `prototype later`, or `reject`
- each finding states evidence type: `source-confirmed`, `README-documented`, `benchmark-documented`, or mixed
- `implementation-summary.md` created at the end
- memory saved from this phase folder using `generate-context.js`

Minimum finding schema:

- finding title
- exact source evidence
- evidence type
- what MemPalace does
- why it matters for `Code_Environment/Public`
- recommendation: `adopt now`, `prototype later`, or `reject`
- affected subsystem
- migration, ambiguity, or truthfulness risk

## 12. Evaluation Criteria

- CLEAR target: `>= 40/50`
- RICCE compliance is visible in the prompt:
  - **Role** is specialized in verbatim memory systems, wake-up layering, MCP protocol design, hooks, and temporal KG behavior
  - **Instructions** are ordered, concrete, path-specific, and honest about evidence boundaries
  - **Context** is domain-specific, cross-phase aware, and corrected for current Public capabilities
  - **Constraints** clearly separate source-confirmed behavior from README or benchmark claims
  - **Examples** show strong MemPalace-derived findings about protocol bootstrapping and hook-driven preservation
- at least 5 findings are evidence-backed rather than speculative
- findings explicitly separate raw-mode strengths from AAAK's experimental status
- findings compare MemPalace against today's Public bootstrap and compaction behavior rather than a stale baseline
- cross-phase overlap with `001` through `004` is explicitly bounded so this phase stays focused on raw-verbatim architecture, wake-up layers, hooks, and KG split

## 13. Completion Bar

The phase is only complete when all of the following are true:

- the reading order covered README honesty notes, CLI/runtime boundaries, MCP server, retrieval layers, palace graph, temporal KG, ingest pipeline, hooks, and benchmarks
- current `Code_Environment/Public` memory/bootstrap/compaction behavior was compared using code, not assumptions
- the validation command passed on this exact phase folder
- the exact deep-research topic string appears in the work
- `research/research.md` contains at least 5 evidence-backed findings
- each finding distinguishes source-confirmed behavior from README or benchmark claims where needed
- `checklist.md` is updated with evidence and completion marks
- `implementation-summary.md` exists
- memory is saved successfully for `005-mempalace`
- no edits were made outside this phase folder
- recommendations explicitly address raw storage, taxonomy, wake-up layering, hooks, and temporal KG patterns

I’m treating this as a read-only deep-research pass for iteration 36, focused on developer workflow impact and migration UX. I’ll do a quick memory/context pass, verify the external scope and validator state, then read the MemPalace and Public source surfaces that affect commands, startup behavior, and rollout guidance.

# Autonomous Deep Research Loop

Iterative research protocol with fresh context per iteration, externalized state, and convergence detection for deep technical investigation.

Runtime path resolution:
- OpenCode/Copilot runtime: `.opencode/agent/*.md`
- Claude runtime: `.claude/agents/*.md`
- Codex runtime: `.codex/agents/*.toml`

<!-- ANCHOR:when-to-use -->
## 1. WHEN TO USE

### When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Deep investigation requiring multiple rounds of discovery
- Topic spans 3+ technical domains or sources
- Initial findings need progressive refinement
- Overnight or unattended research sessions
- Research where prior findings inform subsequent queries

### When NOT to Use

- Simple, single-question research (use direct codebase search or `/spec_kit:plan`)
- Known-solution documentation (use `/spec_kit:plan`)
- Implementation tasks (use `/spec_kit:implement`)
- Quick codebase searches (use `@context` or direct Grep/Glob)
- Fewer than 3 sources needed (single-pass research suffices)

### Keyword Triggers

`autoresearch`, `deep research`, `autonomous research`, `research loop`, `iterative research`, `multi-round research`, `deep investigation`, `comprehensive research`

For iterative code review and quality auditing, see `sk-deep-review`.

### Lifecycle Contract

Live lifecycle branches:
- `resume` — continue the active lineage
- `restart` — start a new generation with explicit parent linkage
- `fork` — branch from the current packet state
- `completed-continue` — reopen a completed lineage only after immutable synthesis snapshotting

## 2. SMART ROUTING

### Resource Loading Levels

### Scoped Guard

```python
def _guard_in_skill():
    """Verify this skill is active before loading resources."""
    if not hasattr(_guard_in_skill, '_active'):
        _guard_in_skill._active = True
    return _guard_in_skill._active

def discover_markdown_resources(base_path: Path) -> list[str]:
    """Discover all .md files in the assets directory."""
    return sorted(str(p.relative_to(base_path)) for p in (base_path / "references").glob("*.md"))
```

### Phase Detection

Detect the current research phase from dispatch context to load appropriate resources:

| Phase | Signal | Resources to Load |
|-------|--------|-------------------|
| Init | No JSONL exists | Loop protocol, state format |
| Iteration | Dispatch context includes iteration number | Loop protocol, convergence |
| Stuck | Dispatch context includes "RECOVERY" | Convergence, loop protocol |
| Synthesis | Convergence triggered STOP | Quick reference |

### Core Innovation: Fresh Context Per Iteration

Each agent dispatch gets a fresh context window. State continuity comes from files, not memory. This solves context degradation in long research sessions.

Adapted from: karpathy/autoresearch (loop concept), AGR (fresh context "Ralph Loop"), pi-autoresearch (JSONL state), autoresearch-opencode (context injection).

### Data Flow

```
Init --> Create config.json, strategy.md, state.jsonl
  |
Loop --> Read state --> Check convergence --> Dispatch @deep-research
  |                                              |
  |                                              v
  |                                         Agent executes:
  |                                         1. Read state files
  |                                         2. Determine focus
  |                                         3. Research (3-5 actions)
  |                                         4. Write iteration-NNN.md
  |                                         5. Update strategy.md
  |                                         6. Append state.jsonl
  |                                              |
  +<--- Evaluate results <-----------------------+
  |
  +--- Continue? --> Yes: next iteration
  |                  No: exit loop
  v
Synthesize --> Compile final research/research.md
  |
Save --> generate-context.js --> verify memory artifact
```

### Key Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Externalized state** | All research continuity via files, not agent memory |
| **Fresh context** | Each iteration gets a clean agent with no prior context |
| **Convergence** | Multi-signal detection: newInfoRatio, stuck count, questions answered |
| **Strategy file** | Reducer-synchronized research steering with machine-owned sections |
| **JSONL log** | Append-only structured log for lineage and iteration data |
| **Findings registry** | Reducer-owned open/resolved questions, key findings, and ruled-out directions |

I’ve confirmed `external/AGENTS.md` is present and the deep-research skill guidance matches this kind of fresh-iteration pass. Next I’m letting the strict validator finish, then I’ll trace the external workflow surfaces and the Public bootstrap/save surfaces side by side so we can isolate the actual developer-facing changes.

# MemPalace

### The highest-scoring AI memory system ever benchmarked. And it's free.

<br>

Every conversation you have with an AI — every decision, every debugging session, every architecture debate — disappears when the session ends. Six months of work, gone. You start over every time.

Other memory systems try to fix this by letting AI decide what's worth remembering. It extracts "user prefers Postgres" and throws away the conversation where you explained *why*. MemPalace takes a different approach: **store everything, then make it findable.**

**The Palace** — Ancient Greek orators memorized entire speeches by placing ideas in rooms of an imaginary building. Walk through the building, find the idea. MemPalace applies the same principle to AI memory: your conversations are organized into wings (people and projects), halls (types of memory), and rooms (specific ideas). No AI decides what matters — you keep every word, and the structure gives you a navigable map instead of a flat search index.

**Raw verbatim storage** — MemPalace stores your actual exchanges in ChromaDB without summarization or extraction. The 96.6% LongMemEval result comes from this raw mode. We don't burn an LLM to decide what's "worth remembering" — we keep everything and let semantic search find it.

**AAAK (experimental)** — A lossy abbreviation dialect for packing repeated entities into fewer tokens at scale. Readable by any LLM that reads text — Claude, GPT, Gemini, Llama, Mistral — no decoder needed. **AAAK is a separate compression layer, not the storage default**, and on the LongMemEval benchmark it currently regresses vs raw mode (84.2% vs 96.6%). We're iterating. See the [note above](#a-note-from-milla--ben--april-7-2026) for the honest status.

**Local, open, adaptable** — MemPalace runs entirely on your machine, on any data you have locally, without using any external API or services. It has been tested on conversations — but it can be adapted for different types of datastores. This is why we're open-sourcing it.

## A Note from Milla & Ben — April 7, 2026

> The community caught real problems in this README within hours of launch and we want to address them directly.
>
> **What we got wrong:**
>
> - **The AAAK token example was incorrect.** We used a rough heuristic (`len(text)//3`) for token counts instead of an actual tokenizer. Real counts via OpenAI's tokenizer: the English example is 66 tokens, the AAAK example is 73. AAAK does not save tokens at small scales — it's designed for *repeated entities at scale*, and the README example was a bad demonstration of that. We're rewriting it.
>
> - **"30x lossless compression" was overstated.** AAAK is a lossy abbreviation system (entity codes, sentence truncation). Independent benchmarks show AAAK mode scores **84.2% R@5 vs raw mode's 96.6%** on LongMemEval — a 12.4 point regression. The honest framing is: AAAK is an experimental compression layer that trades fidelity for token density, and **the 96.6% headline number is from RAW mode, not AAAK**.
>
> - **"+34% palace boost" was misleading.** That number compares unfiltered search to wing+room metadata filtering. Metadata filtering is a standard ChromaDB feature, not a novel retrieval mechanism. Real and useful, but not a moat.
>
> - **"Contradiction detection"** exists as a separate utility (`fact_checker.py`) but is not currently wired into the knowledge graph operations as the README implied.
>
> - **"100% with Haiku rerank"** is real (we have the result files) but the rerank pipeline is not in the public benchmark scripts. We're adding it.
>
> **What's still true and reproducible:**
>
> - **96.6% R@5 on LongMemEval in raw mode**, on 500 questions, zero API calls — independently reproduced on M2 Ultra in under 5 minutes by [@gizmax](https://github.com/milla-jovovich/mempalace/issues/39).
> - Local, free, no subscription, no cloud, no data leaving your machine.
> - The architecture (wings, rooms, closets, drawers) is real and useful, even if it's not a magical retrieval boost.
>
> **What we're doing:**
>
> 1. Rewriting the AAAK example with real tokenizer counts and a scenario where AAAK actually demonstrates compression
> 2. Adding `mode raw / aaak / rooms` clearly to the benchmark documentation so the trade-offs are visible
> 3. Wiring `fact_checker.py` into the KG ops so the contradiction detection claim becomes true
> 4. Pinning ChromaDB to a tested range (Issue #100), fixing the shell injection in hooks (#110), and addressing the macOS ARM64 segfault (#74)
>
> **Thank you to everyone who poked holes in this.** Brutal honest criticism is exactly what makes open source work, and it's what we asked for. Special thanks to [@panuhorsmalahti](https://github.com/milla-jovovich/mempalace/issues/43), [@lhl](https://github.com/milla-jovovich/mempalace/issues/27), [@gizmax](https://github.com/milla-jovovich/mempalace/issues/39), and everyone who filed an issue or a PR in the first 48 hours. We're listening, we're fixing, and we'd rather be right than impressive.

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install mempalace

# Set up your world — who you work with, what your projects are
mempalace init ~/projects/myapp

# Mine your data
mempalace mine ~/projects/myapp                    # projects — code, docs, notes
mempalace mine ~/chats/ --mode convos              # convos — Claude, ChatGPT, Slack exports
mempalace mine ~/chats/ --mode convos --extract general  # general — classifies into decisions, milestones, problems

# Search anything you've ever discussed
mempalace search "why did we switch to GraphQL"

# Your AI remembers
mempalace status
```

Three mining modes: **projects** (code and docs), **convos** (conversation exports), and **general** (auto-classifies into decisions, preferences, milestones, problems, and emotional context). Everything stays on your machine.

---

## How You Actually Use It

After the one-time setup (install → init → mine), you don't run MemPalace commands manually. Your AI uses it for you. There are two ways, depending on which AI you use.

### With Claude Code (recommended)

Native marketplace install:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add milla-jovovich/mempalace
claude plugin install --scope user mempalace
```

Restart Claude Code, then type `/skills` to verify "mempalace" appears.

### With Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, Gemini (MCP-compatible tools)

```bash
# Connect MemPalace once
claude mcp add mempalace -- python -m mempalace.mcp_server
```

Now your AI has 19 tools available through MCP. Ask it anything:

> *"What did we decide about auth last month?"*

Claude calls `mempalace_search` automatically, gets verbatim results, and answers you. You never type `mempalace search` again. The AI handles it.

MemPalace also works natively with **Gemini CLI** (which handles the server and save hooks automatically) — see the [Gemini CLI Integration Guide](examples/gemini_cli_setup.md).

### With local models (Llama, Mistral, or any offline LLM)

Local models generally don't speak MCP yet. Two approaches:

**1. Wake-up command** — load your world into the model's context:

```bash
mempalace wake-up > context.txt
# Paste context.txt into your local model's system prompt
```

This gives your local model ~170 tokens of critical facts (in AAAK if you prefer) before you ask a single question.

**2. CLI search** — query on demand, feed results into your prompt:

```bash
mempalace search "auth decisions" > results.txt
# Include results.txt in your prompt
```

Or use the Python API:

```python
from mempalace.searcher import search_memories
results = search_memories("auth decisions", palace_path="~/.mempalace/palace")
# Inject into your local model's context
```

Either way — your entire memory stack runs offline. ChromaDB on your machine, Llama on your machine, AAAK for compression, zero cloud calls.

---

## The Problem

Decisions happen in conversations now. Not in docs. Not in Jira. In conversations with Claude, ChatGPT, Copilot. The reasoning, the tradeoffs, the "we tried X and it failed because Y" — all trapped in chat windows that evaporate when the session ends.

**Six months of daily AI use = 19.5 million tokens.** That's every decision, every debugging session, every architecture debate. Gone.

| Approach | Tokens loaded | Annual cost |
|----------|--------------|-------------|
| Paste everything | 19.5M — doesn't fit any context window | Impossible |
| LLM summaries | ~650K | ~$507/yr |
| **MemPalace wake-up** | **~170 tokens** | **~$0.70/yr** |
| **MemPalace + 5 searches** | **~13,500 tokens** | **~$10/yr** |

MemPalace loads 170 tokens of critical facts on wake-up — your team, your projects, your preferences. Then searches only when needed. $10/year to remember everything vs $507/year for summaries that lose context.

---

## How It Works

### The Palace

The layout is fairly simple, though it took a long time to get there.

It starts with a **wing**. Every project, person, or topic you're filing gets its own wing in the palace.

Each wing has **rooms** connected to it, where information is divided into subjects that relate to that wing — so every room is a different element of what your project contains. Project ideas could be one room, employees could be another, financial statements another. There can be an endless number of rooms that split the wing into sections. The MemPalace install detects these for you automatically, and of course you can personalize it any way you feel is right.

Every room has a **closet** connected to it, and here's where things get interesting. We've developed an AI language called **AAAK**. Don't ask — it's a whole story of its own. Your agent learns the AAAK shorthand every time it wakes up. Because AAAK is essentially English, but a very truncated version, your agent understands how to use it in seconds. It comes as part of the install, built into the MemPalace code. In our next update, we'll add AAAK directly to the closets, which will be a real game changer — the amount of info in the closets will be much bigger, but it will take up far less space and far less reading time for your agent.

Inside those closets are **drawers**, and those drawers are where your original files live. In this first version, we haven't used AAAK as a closet tool, but even so, the summaries have shown **96.6% recall** in all the benchmarks we've done across multiple benchmarking platforms. Once the closets use AAAK, searches will be even faster while keeping every word exact. But even now, the closet approach has been a huge boon to how much info is stored in a small space — it's used to easily point your AI agent to the drawer where your original file lives. You never lose anything, and all this happens in seconds.

There are also **halls**, which connect rooms within a wing, and **tunnels**, which connect rooms from different wings to one another. So finding things becomes truly effortless — we've given the AI a clean and organized way to know where to start searching, without having to look through every keyword in huge folders.

You say what you're looking for and boom, it already knows which wing to go to. Just *that* in itself would have made a big difference. But this is beautiful, elegant, organic, and most importantly, efficient.

**Wings** — a person or project. As many as you need.
**Rooms** — specific topics within a wing. Auth, billing, deploy — endless rooms.
**Halls** — connections between related rooms *within* the same wing. If Room A (auth) and Room B (security) are related, a hall links them.

The validator finished cleanly on errors and warnings, but it still reports the same temp-file warning and still infers this packet as Level 1. I’m moving into the workflow-specific sources now: command surface, bootstrap/status behavior, wake-up layers, hooks, and the Public equivalents that would absorb any migration.

242:**Closets** — summaries that point to the original content. (In v3.0.0 these are plain-text summaries; AAAK-encoded closets are coming in a future update — see [Task #30](https://github.com/milla-jovovich/mempalace/issues/30).)
280:| **L1** | Critical facts — team, projects, preferences | ~120 tokens (AAAK) | Always loaded |
286:### AAAK Dialect (experimental)
288:AAAK is a lossy abbreviation system — entity codes, structural markers, and sentence truncation — designed to pack repeated entities and relationships into fewer tokens at scale. It is **readable by any LLM that reads text** (Claude, GPT, Gemini, Llama, Mistral) without a decoder, so a local model can use it without any cloud dependency.
290:**Honest status (April 2026):**
292:- **AAAK is lossy, not lossless.** It uses regex-based abbreviation, not reversible compression.
293:- **It does not save tokens at small scales.** Short text already tokenizes efficiently. AAAK overhead (codes, separators) costs more than it saves on a few sentences.
295:- **AAAK currently regresses LongMemEval** vs raw verbatim retrieval (84.2% R@5 vs 96.6%). The 96.6% headline number is from **raw mode**, not AAAK mode.
296:- **The MemPalace storage default is raw verbatim text in ChromaDB** — that's where the benchmark wins come from. AAAK is a separate compression layer for context loading, not the storage format.
431:- **Keeps a diary** — written in AAAK, persists across sessions
441:# → last 10 findings, compressed in AAAK

473:| `mempalace_get_aaak_spec` | AAAK dialect reference |
504:| `mempalace_diary_write` | Write AAAK diary entry |
507:The AI learns AAAK and the memory protocol automatically from the `mempalace_status` response. No manual configuration.
513:Two hooks for Claude Code that automatically save memories during work:
517:**PreCompact Hook** — fires before context compression. Emergency save before the window shrinks.
521:  "hooks": {
522:    "Stop": [{"matcher": "", "hooks": [{"type": "command", "command": "/path/to/mempalace/hooks/mempal_save_hook.sh"}]}],

528:**Optional auto-ingest:** Set the `MEMPAL_DIR` environment variable to a directory path and the hooks will automatically run `mempalace mine` on that directory during each save trigger (background on stop, synchronous on precompact).

MemPalace — Give your AI a memory. No API key required.

Two ways to ingest:
  Projects:      mempalace mine ~/projects/my_app          (code, docs, notes)
  Conversations: mempalace mine ~/chats/ --mode convos     (Claude, ChatGPT, Slack)

Same palace. Same search. Different ingest strategies.

Commands:
    mempalace init <dir>                  Detect rooms from folder structure
    mempalace split <dir>                 Split concatenated mega-files into per-session files
    mempalace mine <dir>                  Mine project files (default)
    mempalace mine <dir> --mode convos    Mine conversation exports
    mempalace search "query"              Find anything, exact words
    mempalace mcp                         Show MCP setup command
    mempalace wake-up                     Show L0 + L1 wake-up context
    mempalace wake-up --wing my_app       Wake-up for a specific project
    mempalace status                      Show what's been filed

Examples:
    mempalace init ~/projects/my_app
    mempalace mine ~/projects/my_app
    mempalace mine ~/chats/claude-sessions --mode convos
    mempalace search "why did we switch to GraphQL"
    mempalace search "pricing discussion" --wing my_app --room costs

I’ve got the external command surface and the status/bootstrap protocol pinned down now. The pattern is pretty clear already: MemPalace changes developer workflow less through raw retrieval itself and more through always-on behavior teaching, diary/save rituals, and a wake-up/recovery sequence the agent is expected to follow every session.

knowledge_graph.py — Temporal Entity-Relationship Graph for MemPalace
=====================================================================

Real knowledge graph with:
  - Entity nodes (people, projects, tools, concepts)
  - Typed relationship edges (daughter_of, does, loves, works_on, etc.)
  - Temporal validity (valid_from → valid_to — knows WHEN facts are true)
  - Closet references (links back to the verbatim memory)

Storage: SQLite (local, no dependencies, no subscriptions)
Query: entity-first traversal with time filtering

This is what competes with Zep's temporal knowledge graph.
Zep uses Neo4j in the cloud ($25/mo+). We use SQLite locally (free).

Usage:
    from mempalace.knowledge_graph import KnowledgeGraph

    kg = KnowledgeGraph()
    kg.add_triple("Max", "child_of", "Alice", valid_from="2015-04-01")
    kg.add_triple("Max", "does", "swimming", valid_from="2025-01-01")
    kg.add_triple("Max", "loves", "chess", valid_from="2025-10-01")

    # Query: everything about Max
    kg.query_entity("Max")

    # Query: what was true about Max in January 2026?
    kg.query_entity("Max", as_of="2026-01-15")

    # Query: who is connected to Alice?
    kg.query_entity("Alice", direction="both")

    # Invalidate: Max's sports injury resolved
    kg.invalidate("Max", "has_issue", "sports_injury", ended="2026-02-15")

# MEMPALACE SAVE HOOK — Auto-save every N exchanges
#
# Claude Code "Stop" hook. After every assistant response:
# 1. Counts human messages in the session transcript
# 2. Every SAVE_INTERVAL messages, BLOCKS the AI from stopping
# 3. Returns a reason telling the AI to save structured diary + palace entries
# 4. AI does the save (topics, decisions, code, quotes → organized into palace)
# 5. Next Stop fires with stop_hook_active=true → lets AI stop normally
#
# The AI does the classification — it knows what wing/hall/closet to use
# because it has context about the conversation. No regex needed.
#
# === INSTALL ===
# Add to .claude/settings.local.json:
#
#   "hooks": {
#     "Stop": [{
#       "matcher": "*",
#       "hooks": [{
#         "type": "command",
#         "command": "/absolute/path/to/mempal_save_hook.sh",
#         "timeout": 30
#       }]

#   }
#
# For Codex CLI, add to .codex/hooks.json:
#
#   "Stop": [{
#     "type": "command",
#     "command": "/absolute/path/to/mempal_save_hook.sh",
#     "timeout": 30
#   }]
#
# === HOW IT WORKS ===
#
# Claude Code sends JSON on stdin with these fields:
#   session_id       — unique session identifier
#   stop_hook_active — true if AI is already in a save cycle (prevents infinite loop)
#   transcript_path  — path to the JSONL transcript file
#
# When we block, Claude Code shows our "reason" to the AI as a system message.
# The AI then saves to memory, and when it tries to stop again,
# stop_hook_active=true so we let it through. No infinite loop.
#
# === MEMPALACE CLI ===
# This repo uses: mempalace mine <dir>
# or:            mempalace mine <dir> --mode convos
# Set MEMPAL_DIR below if you want the hook to auto-ingest after blocking.
# Leave blank to rely on the AI's own save instructions.

# MemPalace Hooks — Auto-Save for Terminal AI Tools

These hook scripts make MemPalace save automatically. No manual "save" commands needed.

## What They Do

| Hook | When It Fires | What Happens |
|------|--------------|-------------|
| **Save Hook** | Every 15 human messages | Blocks the AI, tells it to save key topics/decisions/quotes to the palace |
| **PreCompact Hook** | Right before context compaction | Emergency save — forces the AI to save EVERYTHING before losing context |

The AI does the actual filing — it knows the conversation context, so it classifies memories into the right wings/halls/closets. The hooks just tell it WHEN to save.

## Install — Claude Code

Add to `.claude/settings.local.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "Stop": [{
      "matcher": "*",
      "hooks": [{
        "type": "command",
        "command": "/absolute/path/to/hooks/mempal_save_hook.sh",
        "timeout": 30
      }]
    }],
    "PreCompact": [{
      "hooks": [{
        "type": "command",
        "command": "/absolute/path/to/hooks/mempal_precompact_hook.sh",
        "timeout": 30
      }]
    }]
  }
}
```

Make them executable:
```bash
chmod +x hooks/mempal_save_hook.sh hooks/mempal_precompact_hook.sh
```

## Install — Codex CLI (OpenAI)

Add to `.codex/hooks.json`:

```json
{
  "Stop": [{
    "type": "command",
    "command": "/absolute/path/to/hooks/mempal_save_hook.sh",
    "timeout": 30
  }],
  "PreCompact": [{
    "type": "command",
    "command": "/absolute/path/to/hooks/mempal_precompact_hook.sh",
    "timeout": 30
  }]
}
```

## Configuration

Edit `mempal_save_hook.sh` to change:

- **`SAVE_INTERVAL=15`** — How many human messages between saves. Lower = more frequent saves, higher = less interruption.
- **`STATE_DIR`** — Where hook state is stored (defaults to `~/.mempalace/hook_state/`)
- **`MEMPAL_DIR`** — Optional. Set to a conversations directory to auto-run `mempalace mine <dir>` on each save trigger. Leave blank (default) to let the AI handle saving via the block reason message.

### mempalace CLI

The relevant commands are:

```bash
mempalace mine <dir>               # Mine all files in a directory
mempalace mine <dir> --mode convos # Mine conversation transcripts only
```

The hooks resolve the repo root automatically from their own path, so they work regardless of where you install the repo.

## How It Works (Technical)

### Save Hook (Stop event)

```
User sends message → AI responds → Claude Code fires Stop hook
                                            ↓
                                    Hook counts human messages in JSONL transcript
                                            ↓
                              ┌─── < 15 since last save ──→ echo "{}" (let AI stop)
                              │
                              └─── ≥ 15 since last save ──→ {"decision": "block", "reason": "save..."}
                                                                    ↓
                                                            AI saves to palace
                                                                    ↓
                                                            AI tries to stop again
                                                                    ↓
                                                            stop_hook_active = true
                                                                    ↓
                                                            Hook sees flag → echo "{}" (let it through)
```

The `stop_hook_active` flag prevents infinite loops: block once → AI saves → tries to stop → flag is true → we let it through.

### PreCompact Hook

```
Context window getting full → Claude Code fires PreCompact
                                        ↓
                                Hook ALWAYS blocks
                                        ↓
                                AI saves everything
                                        ↓
                                Compaction proceeds
```

No counting needed — compaction always warrants a save.

## Debugging

Check the hook log:
```bash
cat ~/.mempalace/hook_state/hook.log
```

Example output:
```
[14:30:15] Session abc123: 12 exchanges, 12 since last save
[14:35:22] Session abc123: 15 exchanges, 15 since last save
[14:35:22] TRIGGERING SAVE at exchange 15
[14:40:01] Session abc123: 18 exchanges, 3 since last save
```

## Cost

**Zero extra tokens.** The hooks are bash scripts that run locally. They don't call any API. The only "cost" is the AI spending a few seconds organizing memories at each checkpoint — and it's doing that with context it already has loaded.

# MEMPALACE PRE-COMPACT HOOK — Emergency save before compaction
#
# Claude Code "PreCompact" hook. Fires RIGHT BEFORE the conversation
# gets compressed to free up context window space.
#
# This is the safety net. When compaction happens, the AI loses detailed
# context about what was discussed. This hook forces one final save of
# EVERYTHING before that happens.
#
# Unlike the save hook (which triggers every N exchanges), this ALWAYS
# blocks — because compaction is always worth saving before.

# MemPal Benchmark Results — Full Progression

**March 2026 — The complete record from baseline to state-of-the-art.**

---

## The Core Finding

Every competitive memory system uses an LLM to manage memory:
- Mem0 uses an LLM to extract facts
- Mastra uses GPT-5-mini to observe conversations
- Supermemory uses an LLM to run agentic search passes

They all start from the assumption that you need AI to decide what to remember.

**MemPal's baseline just stores the actual words and searches them with ChromaDB's default embeddings. No extraction. No summarization. No AI deciding what matters. And it scores 96.6% on LongMemEval.**

That's the finding. The field is over-engineering the memory extraction step. Raw verbatim text with good embeddings is a stronger baseline than anyone realized — because it doesn't lose information. When an LLM extracts "user prefers PostgreSQL" and throws away the original conversation, it loses the context of *why*, the alternatives considered, the tradeoffs discussed. MemPal keeps all of that, and the search model finds it.

Nobody published this result because nobody tried the simple thing and measured it properly.

---

## The Two Honest Numbers

These are different claims. They need to be presented as a pair.

| Mode | LongMemEval R@5 | LLM Required | Cost per Query |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Raw ChromaDB** | **96.6%** | None | $0 |
| **Hybrid v4 + Haiku rerank** | **100%** | Haiku (optional) | ~$0.001 |
| **Hybrid v4 + Sonnet rerank** | **100%** | Sonnet (optional) | ~$0.003 |

The 96.6% is the product story: free, private, one dependency, no API key, runs entirely offline.

The 100% is the competitive story: a perfect score on the standard benchmark for AI memory, verified across all 500 questions and all 6 question types — reproducible with either Haiku or Sonnet as the reranker.

Both are real. Both are reproducible. Neither is the whole picture alone.

---

## Comparison vs Published Systems (LongMemEval)

| # | System | R@5 | LLM Required | Which LLM | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **MemPal (hybrid v4 + rerank)** | **100%** | Optional | Haiku | Reproducible, 500/500 |
| 2 | Supermemory ASMR | ~99% | Yes | Undisclosed | Research only, not in production |
| 3 | MemPal (hybrid v3 + rerank) | 99.4% | Optional | Haiku | Reproducible |
| 3 | MemPal (palace + rerank) | 99.4% | Optional | Haiku | Independent architecture |
| 4 | Mastra | 94.87% | Yes | GPT-5-mini | — |
| 5 | **MemPal (raw, no LLM)** | **96.6%** | **None** | **None** | **Highest zero-API score published** |
| 6 | Hindsight | 91.4% | Yes | Gemini-3 | — |
| 7 | Supermemory (production) | ~85% | Yes | Undisclosed | — |
| 8 | Stella (dense retriever) | ~85% | None | None | Academic baseline |
| 9 | Contriever | ~78% | None | None | Academic baseline |
| 10 | BM25 (sparse) | ~70% | None | None | Keyword baseline |

**MemPal raw (96.6%) is the highest published LongMemEval score that requires no API key, no cloud, and no LLM at any stage.**

**MemPal hybrid v4 + Haiku rerank (100%) is the first perfect score on LongMemEval — 500/500 questions, all 6 question types at 100%.**

---

## Other Benchmarks

### ConvoMem (Salesforce, 75K+ QA pairs)

| System | Score | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **MemPal** | **92.9%** | Verbatim text, semantic search |
| Gemini (long context) | 70–82% | Full history in context window |
| Block extraction | 57–71% | LLM-processed blocks |
| Mem0 (RAG) | 30–45% | LLM-extracted memories |

MemPal is more than 2× Mem0 on this benchmark. With Sonnet rerank, MemPal reaches **100% on LoCoMo** across all 5 question types including temporal-inference (was 46% at baseline).

**Why MemPal beats Mem0 by 2×:** Mem0 uses an LLM to extract memories — it decides what to remember and discards the rest. When it extracts the wrong thing, the memory is gone. MemPal stores verbatim text. Nothing is discarded. The simpler approach wins because it doesn't lose information.

**Per-category breakdown:**

| Category | Recall | Grade |
|---|---|---|
| Assistant Facts | 100% | Perfect |
| User Facts | 98.0% | Excellent |
| Abstention | 91.0% | Strong |
| Implicit Connections | 89.3% | Good |
| Preferences | 86.0% | Good — weakest category |

### LoCoMo (1,986 multi-hop QA pairs)

| Mode | R@5 | R@10 | LLM | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Hybrid v5 + Sonnet rerank (top-50)** | **100%** | **100%** | Sonnet | Structurally guaranteed (top-k > sessions) |
| **bge-large + Haiku rerank (top-15)** | — | **96.3%** | Haiku | Single-hop 86.6%, temporal-inf 87.0% |
| **bge-large hybrid (top-10)** | — | **92.4%** | None | +3.5pp over all-MiniLM, single-hop +10.6pp |
| **Hybrid v5 (top-10)** | 83.7% | **88.9%** | None | Beats Memori 81.95% — honest score |
| **Wings v3 speaker-owned closets (top-10)** | — | **85.7%** | None | Adversarial 92.8% — speaker ownership solves speaker confusion |
| **Wings v2 concept closets (top-10)** | — | **75.6%** | None | Adversarial 80.0%; single-hop 49% drags overall |
| **Palace v2 (top-10, 3 rooms)** | 75.6% | **84.8%** | Haiku (index) | Room assignment at index; summary routing at query |
| Wings v1 (broken — filter not boost) | — | 58.0% | None | Speaker WHERE filter discarded evidence; 5.4% coverage |
| Palace v1 (top-5, global LLM routing) | 34.2% | — | Haiku (both) | Fails: taxonomy mismatch |
| Session, no rerank (top-10) | — | 60.3% | None | Baseline |
| Dialog, no rerank (top-10) | — | 48.0% | None | — |

**Wings v2 per-category breakdown (top-10, no LLM):**

| Category | Wings v1 | Wings v2 | Delta |
|---|---|---|---|
| Single-hop | ~52% | 49.0% | -3pp |
| Temporal | ~64% | 79.2% | +15pp |
| Temporal-inference | ~53% | 49.1% | -4pp |
| Open-domain | ~71% | 83.7% | +13pp |
| **Adversarial** | **34.0%** | **80.0%** | **+46pp** |

**Wings v3 per-category breakdown (top-10, no LLM):**

| Category | Wings v1 | Wings v2 | Wings v3 | Hybrid v5 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Single-hop | ~52% | 49.0% | **65.3%** | ~70%? |
| Temporal | ~64% | 79.2% | **87.3%** | ~87%? |
| Temporal-inference | ~53% | 49.1% | **63.2%** | ~65%? |
| Open-domain | ~71% | 83.7% | **90.7%** | ~90%? |
| **Adversarial** | **34.0%** | **80.0%** | **92.8%** | — |

Wings v3 design: one closet per speaker per session. Owner's turns verbatim; other speaker's turns as `[context]` labels. 38 closets/conversation vs 184 (v2) → 26% coverage with top-10. Adversarial score (92.8%) exceeds bge-large overall (92.4%) — speaker ownership almost completely solves the speaker-confusion category.

Root cause of wings v1 failure: (1) speaker WHERE filter discarded evidence about Caroline when evidence lived in a John-tagged closet (John spoke more words but conversation was about Caroline); (2) top_k=10 from ~184 closets = 5.4% coverage vs 37% in session mode. Fix: retrieve all closets, use speaker match as 15% distance boost instead of filter.

**With Sonnet rerank, MemPal achieves 100% on every LoCoMo question type — including temporal-inference, which was the hardest category at baseline.**

**Per-category breakdown (hybrid + Sonnet rerank):**

| Category | Recall | Baseline | Delta |
|---|---|---|---|
| Single-hop | 1.000 | 59.0% | +41.0pp |
| Temporal | 1.000 | 69.2% | +30.8pp |
| **Temporal-inference** | **1.000** | **46.0%** | **+54.0pp** |
| Open-domain | 1.000 | 58.1% | +41.9pp |
| Adversarial | 1.000 | 61.9% | +38.1pp |

**Temporal-inference was the hardest category** — questions requiring connections across multiple sessions. Hybrid scoring (person name boost, quoted phrase boost) combined with Sonnet's reading comprehension closes this gap entirely. From 46% to 100%.

## LongMemEval — Breakdown by Question Type

The 96.6% R@5 baseline broken down by the six question categories in LongMemEval:

| Question Type | R@5 | R@10 | Count | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Knowledge update | 99.0% | 100% | 78 | Strongest — facts that changed over time |
| Multi-session | 98.5% | 100% | 133 | Very strong |
| Temporal reasoning | 96.2% | 97.0% | 133 | Strong |
| Single-session user | 95.7% | 97.1% | 70 | Strong |
| Single-session preference | 93.3% | 96.7% | 30 | Good — preferences stated indirectly |
| Single-session assistant | 92.9% | 96.4% | 56 | Weakest — questions about what the AI said |

The two weakest categories point to specific fixes:
- **Single-session assistant (92.9%)**: Questions ask about what the assistant said, not the user. Fixed by indexing assistant turns as well as user turns.
- **Single-session preference (93.3%)**: Preferences are often stated indirectly ("I usually prefer X"). Fixed by the preference extraction patterns in hybrid v3.

Both were addressed in the improvements that took the score from 96.6% to 99.4%.

---

## The Full Progression — How We Got from 96.6% to 99.4%

Every improvement below was a response to specific failure patterns in the results. Nothing was added speculatively.

### Starting Point: Raw ChromaDB (96.6%)

The baseline: store every session verbatim as a single document. Query with ChromaDB's default embeddings (all-MiniLM-L6-v2). No postprocessing.

This was the first result. Nobody expected it to work this well. The team's hypothesis was that raw verbatim storage would lose to systems that extract structured facts. The 96.6% proved the hypothesis wrong.

**What it does:** Stores verbatim session text. Embeds with sentence transformers. Retrieves by cosine similarity.

**What it misses:** Questions with vocabulary mismatch ("yoga classes" vs "I went this morning"), preference questions where the preference is implied, temporally-ambiguous questions where multiple sessions match.

---

### Improvement 1: Hybrid Scoring v1 → 97.8% (+1.2%)

**What changed:** Added keyword overlap scoring on top of embedding similarity.

```
fused_score = embedding_score × (1 + keyword_weight × overlap)
```

When query keywords appear verbatim in a session, that session gets a small boost. The boost is mild enough not to hurt recall when keywords don't match.

**Why it worked:** Some questions use exact terminology ("PostgreSQL", "Dr. Chen", specific names). Pure embedding similarity can rank a semantically-close session above the exact match. Keyword overlap rescues these cases.

**What it still misses:** Temporally-ambiguous questions. Sessions from the right time period rank equally with sessions from wrong time periods.

---

### Improvement 2: Hybrid Scoring v2 → 98.4% (+0.6%)

**What changed:** Added temporal boost — sessions near the question's reference date get a distance reduction (up to 40%).

```python
# Sessions near question_date - offset get score boost
if temporal_distance < threshold:
    fused_dist *= (1.0 - temporal_boost * proximity_factor)
```

**Why it worked:** Many LongMemEval questions are anchored to a specific time ("what did you do last month?"). Multiple sessions might semantically match, but only one is temporally correct. The boost breaks ties in favor of the right time period.

---

### Improvement 3: Hybrid v2 + Haiku Rerank → 98.8% (+0.4%)

**What changed:** After retrieval, send the top-K candidates to Claude Haiku with the question. Ask Haiku to re-rank by relevance.

**Why it worked:** Embeddings measure semantic similarity, not answer relevance. Haiku can read the question and the retrieved documents and reason about which one actually answers the question — a task embeddings fundamentally cannot do.

**Cost:** ~$0.001/query for Haiku. Optional — the system runs fine without it.

---

### Improvement 4: Hybrid v3 + Haiku Rerank → 99.4% (+0.6%)

**What changed:** Added preference extraction — 16 regex patterns that detect how people actually express preferences in conversation, then create synthetic "User has mentioned: X" documents at index time.

Examples of what gets caught:
- "I usually prefer X" → `User has mentioned: preference for X`
- "I always do Y" → `User has mentioned: always does Y`
- "I don't like Z" → `User has mentioned: dislikes Z`

**Why it worked:** Preference questions are consistently hard for pure embedding retrieval. "What does the user prefer for database backends?" doesn't semantically match "I find Postgres more reliable in my experience" — but it does match a synthetic document that says "User has mentioned: finds Postgres more reliable." The explicit extraction bridges the vocabulary gap without losing the verbatim original.

**Why 16 patterns:** Manual analysis of the miss cases. Each pattern corresponds to a real failure mode found in the wrong-answer JSONL files.

### Improvement 5: Hybrid v4 + Haiku Rerank → **100%** (+0.6%)

**What changed:** Three targeted fixes for the three questions that failed in every previous mode.

The remaining misses were identified by loading both the hybrid v3 and palace results and finding the exact questions that failed in *both* architectures — confirming they were hard limits, not luck.

**Fix 1 — Quoted phrase extraction** (miss: `'sexual compulsions'` assistant question):
The question contained an exact quoted phrase in single quotes. Sessions containing that exact phrase now get a 60% distance reduction. The target session jumped from unranked to rank 1.

**Fix 2 — Person name boosting** (miss: `Rachel/ukulele` temporal question):
Sentence-embedded models give insufficient weight to person names. Capitalized proper nouns are extracted from queries; sessions mentioning that name get a 40% distance reduction. The target session jumped from unranked to rank 2.

**Fix 3 — Memory/nostalgia patterns** (miss: `high school reunion` preference question):
The target session said "I still remember the happy high school experiences such as being part of the debate team." Added patterns to preference extraction: `"I still remember X"`, `"I used to X"`, `"when I was in high school X"`, `"growing up X"`. This created a synthetic doc "User has mentioned: positive high school experiences, debate team, AP courses" — which the reunion question now matches. Target session jumped to rank 3.

**Result:** All 6 question types at 100% R@5. 500/500 questions. No regressions.

**Haiku vs. Sonnet rerank:** Both achieve 100% R@5. NDCG@10 is 0.976 (Haiku) vs 0.975 (Sonnet) — statistically identical. Haiku is ~3× cheaper. Sonnet is slightly faster at this task (2.99s/q vs 3.85s/q in our run). Either works; Haiku is the default recommendation.

---

### Parallel Approach: Palace Mode + Haiku Rerank → 99.4% (independent convergence)

Built independently from the hybrid track. Different architecture, same ceiling.

codex
I’m in the comparison phase now. The external side keeps nudging the agent into a ritualized loop: `status` to learn protocol, `search/kg` before answering, diary at session end, and hooks before stop/compaction. I’m checking the Public sources against exactly those touchpoints so the migration advice stays concrete instead of hand-wavy.

  Creates a memory file in <spec-folder>/memory/ with ANCHOR format
  for indexing by the Spec Kit Memory system.

Preferred save path (JSON-PRIMARY):
  - ALWAYS use --stdin, --json, or a JSON temp file.
  - The AI has strictly better information about its own session than any DB query can reconstruct.
  - Explicit CLI targets still outrank payload specFolder values in every structured-input mode.

Direct CLI target rule:
  - When a spec folder is passed on the CLI, that explicit target is authoritative.
  - Session learning, JSON SPEC_FOLDER fields, and auto-detect may inform logging,
    but they must not reroute the save to another folder.

Each agent is a specialist lens on your data. The reviewer remembers every bug pattern it's seen. The architect remembers every design decision. The ops agent remembers every incident. They don't share a scratchpad — they each maintain their own memory.

Letta charges $20–200/mo for agent-managed memory. MemPalace does it with a wing.

## MCP Server

```bash
# Via plugin (recommended)
claude plugin marketplace add milla-jovovich/mempalace
claude plugin install --scope user mempalace

# Or manually
claude mcp add mempalace -- python -m mempalace.mcp_server
```

### 19 Tools

**Palace (read)**

| Tool | What |
|------|------|
| `mempalace_status` | Palace overview + AAAK spec + memory protocol |
| `mempalace_list_wings` | Wings with counts |
| `mempalace_list_rooms` | Rooms within a wing |
| `mempalace_get_taxonomy` | Full wing → room → count tree |
| `mempalace_search` | Semantic search with wing/room filters |
| `mempalace_check_duplicate` | Check before filing |
| `mempalace_get_aaak_spec` | AAAK dialect reference |

**Palace (write)**

| Tool | What |
|------|------|
| `mempalace_add_drawer` | File verbatim content |
| `mempalace_delete_drawer` | Remove by ID |

**Knowledge Graph**

| Tool | What |
|------|------|
| `mempalace_kg_query` | Entity relationships with time filtering |
| `mempalace_kg_add` | Add facts |
| `mempalace_kg_invalidate` | Mark facts as ended |
| `mempalace_kg_timeline` | Chronological entity story |
| `mempalace_kg_stats` | Graph overview |

**Navigation**

| Tool | What |
|------|------|
| `mempalace_traverse` | Walk the graph from a room across wings |

## Auto-Save Hooks

Two hooks for Claude Code that automatically save memories during work:

**Save Hook** — every 15 messages, triggers a structured save. Topics, decisions, quotes, code changes. Also regenerates the critical facts layer.

**PreCompact Hook** — fires before context compression. Emergency save before the window shrinks.

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "Stop": [{"matcher": "", "hooks": [{"type": "command", "command": "/path/to/mempalace/hooks/mempal_save_hook.sh"}]}],
    "PreCompact": [{"matcher": "", "hooks": [{"type": "command", "command": "/path/to/mempalace/hooks/mempal_precompact_hook.sh"}]}]
  }
}
```

**Optional auto-ingest:** Set the `MEMPAL_DIR` environment variable to a directory path and the hooks will automatically run `mempalace mine` on that directory during each save trigger (background on stop, synchronous on precompact).

codex
The workflow shifts are crystallizing into a small set of real changes: a taught startup protocol, a stronger save/checkpoint ritual, a wake-up/onboarding layer, and optional diary/fact-maintenance surfaces. I’m pulling exact line-numbered evidence now so the iteration output can be precise and durable.

     3	#
     4	# Claude Code "PreCompact" hook. Fires RIGHT BEFORE the conversation
     5	# gets compressed to free up context window space.
     6	#
     7	# This is the safety net. When compaction happens, the AI loses detailed
     8	# context about what was discussed. This hook forces one final save of
     9	# EVERYTHING before that happens.
    10	#
    11	# Unlike the save hook (which triggers every N exchanges), this ALWAYS
    12	# blocks — because compaction is always worth saving before.
    13	#
    14	# === INSTALL ===
    15	# Add to .claude/settings.local.json:
    16	#
    17	#   "hooks": {
    18	#     "PreCompact": [{
    19	#       "hooks": [{
    20	#         "type": "command",
    21	#         "command": "/absolute/path/to/mempal_precompact_hook.sh",
    22	#         "timeout": 30
    23	#       }]
    24	#     }]
    25	#   }
    26	#
    27	# For Codex CLI, add to .codex/hooks.json:
    28	#
    29	#   "PreCompact": [{
    30	#     "type": "command",

    32	#     "timeout": 30
    33	#   }]
    34	#
    35	# === HOW IT WORKS ===

    37	# Claude Code sends JSON on stdin with:
    38	#   session_id — unique session identifier
    39	#
    40	# We always return decision: "block" with a reason telling the AI
    41	# to save everything. After the AI saves, compaction proceeds normally.
    42	#
    43	# === MEMPALACE CLI ===
    44	# This repo uses: mempalace mine <dir>
    45	# or:            mempalace mine <dir> --mode convos
    46	# Set MEMPAL_DIR below if you want the hook to auto-ingest before compaction.

    58	> - **The AAAK token example was incorrect.** We used a rough heuristic (`len(text)//3`) for token counts instead of an actual tokenizer. Real counts via OpenAI's tokenizer: the English example is 66 tokens, the AAAK example is 73. AAAK does not save tokens at small scales — it's designed for *repeated entities at scale*, and the README example was a bad demonstration of that. We're rewriting it.
    59	>
    60	> - **"30x lossless compression" was overstated.** AAAK is a lossy abbreviation system (entity codes, sentence truncation). Independent benchmarks show AAAK mode scores **84.2% R@5 vs raw mode's 96.6%** on LongMemEval — a 12.4 point regression. The honest framing is: AAAK is an experimental compression layer that trades fidelity for token density, and **the 96.6% headline number is from RAW mode, not AAAK**.
    61	>
    62	> - **"+34% palace boost" was misleading.** That number compares unfiltered search to wing+room metadata filtering. Metadata filtering is a standard ChromaDB feature, not a novel retrieval mechanism. Real and useful, but not a moat.
    63	>
    64	> - **"Contradiction detection"** exists as a separate utility (`fact_checker.py`) but is not currently wired into the knowledge graph operations as the README implied.
    65	>
    66	> - **"100% with Haiku rerank"** is real (we have the result files) but the rerank pipeline is not in the public benchmark scripts. We're adding it.
    67	>
    68	> **What's still true and reproducible:**
    69	>
    70	> - **96.6% R@5 on LongMemEval in raw mode**, on 500 questions, zero API calls — independently reproduced on M2 Ultra in under 5 minutes by [@gizmax](https://github.com/milla-jovovich/mempalace/issues/39).
    71	> - Local, free, no subscription, no cloud, no data leaving your machine.
    72	> - The architecture (wings, rooms, closets, drawers) is real and useful, even if it's not a magical retrieval boost.
    73	>
    74	> **What we're doing:**
    75	>
    76	> 1. Rewriting the AAAK example with real tokenizer counts and a scenario where AAAK actually demonstrates compression
    77	> 2. Adding `mode raw / aaak / rooms` clearly to the benchmark documentation so the trade-offs are visible
    78	> 3. Wiring `fact_checker.py` into the KG ops so the contradiction detection claim becomes true
    79	> 4. Pinning ChromaDB to a tested range (Issue #100), fixing the shell injection in hooks (#110), and addressing the macOS ARM64 segfault (#74)
    80	>
    87	## Quick Start
    88	
    89	```bash
    90	pip install mempalace
    91	
    92	# Set up your world — who you work with, what your projects are
    93	mempalace init ~/projects/myapp
    94	
    95	# Mine your data
    96	mempalace mine ~/projects/myapp                    # projects — code, docs, notes
    97	mempalace mine ~/chats/ --mode convos              # convos — Claude, ChatGPT, Slack exports
    98	mempalace mine ~/chats/ --mode convos --extract general  # general — classifies into decisions, milestones, problems
    99	
   100	# Search anything you've ever discussed
   101	mempalace search "why did we switch to GraphQL"
   102	
   103	# Your AI remembers
   104	mempalace status
   105	```
   106	
   107	Three mining modes: **projects** (code and docs), **convos** (conversation exports), and **general** (auto-classifies into decisions, preferences, milestones, problems, and emotional context). Everything stays on your machine.
   108	
   109	---
   110	
   111	## How You Actually Use It
   112	
   113	After the one-time setup (install → init → mine), you don't run MemPalace commands manually. Your AI uses it for you. There are two ways, depending on which AI you use.
   114	
   115	### With Claude Code (recommended)
   116	
   117	Native marketplace install:
   118	
   119	```bash
   120	claude plugin marketplace add milla-jovovich/mempalace
   121	claude plugin install --scope user mempalace
   122	```
   123	
   124	Restart Claude Code, then type `/skills` to verify "mempalace" appears.
   125	
   126	### With Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, Gemini (MCP-compatible tools)
   127	
   128	```bash
   129	# Connect MemPalace once
   130	claude mcp add mempalace -- python -m mempalace.mcp_server
   131	```
   132	
   133	Now your AI has 19 tools available through MCP. Ask it anything:
   134	
   135	> *"What did we decide about auth last month?"*
   136	
   137	Claude calls `mempalace_search` automatically, gets verbatim results, and answers you. You never type `mempalace search` again. The AI handles it.
   138	
   139	MemPalace also works natively with **Gemini CLI** (which handles the server and save hooks automatically) — see the [Gemini CLI Integration Guide](examples/gemini_cli_setup.md).
   140	
   141	### With local models (Llama, Mistral, or any offline LLM)
   142	
   143	Local models generally don't speak MCP yet. Two approaches:
   144	
   145	**1. Wake-up command** — load your world into the model's context:
   146	
   147	```bash
   148	mempalace wake-up > context.txt
   149	# Paste context.txt into your local model's system prompt
   150	```
   151	
   152	This gives your local model ~170 tokens of critical facts (in AAAK if you prefer) before you ask a single question.
   153	
   154	**2. CLI search** — query on demand, feed results into your prompt:
   155	
   156	```bash
   157	mempalace search "auth decisions" > results.txt
   158	# Include results.txt in your prompt
   159	```
   160	
   161	Or use the Python API:
   162	
   163	```python
   164	from mempalace.searcher import search_memories
   165	results = search_memories("auth decisions", palace_path="~/.mempalace/palace")
   166	# Inject into your local model's context
   167	```
   168	
   169	Either way — your entire memory stack runs offline. ChromaDB on your machine, Llama on your machine, AAAK for compression, zero cloud calls.
   170	
   430	- **Has a focus** — what it pays attention to
   431	- **Keeps a diary** — written in AAAK, persists across sessions
   432	- **Builds expertise** — reads its own history to stay sharp in its domain
   433	
   434	```
   435	# Agent writes to its diary after a code review
   436	mempalace_diary_write("reviewer",
   437	    "PR#42|auth.bypass.found|missing.middleware.check|pattern:3rd.time.this.quarter|★★★★")
   438	
   439	# Agent reads back its history
   440	mempalace_diary_read("reviewer", last_n=10)
   441	# → last 10 findings, compressed in AAAK
   442	```
   443	
   444	Each agent is a specialist lens on your data. The reviewer remembers every bug pattern it's seen. The architect remembers every design decision. The ops agent remembers every incident. They don't share a scratchpad — they each maintain their own memory.
   445	
   446	Letta charges $20–200/mo for agent-managed memory. MemPalace does it with a wing.
   447

   450	## MCP Server
   451

   454	claude plugin marketplace add milla-jovovich/mempalace
   455	claude plugin install --scope user mempalace
   456	
   457	# Or manually
   458	claude mcp add mempalace -- python -m mempalace.mcp_server

   510	
   511	## Auto-Save Hooks
   512	
   513	Two hooks for Claude Code that automatically save memories during work:
   514	
   515	**Save Hook** — every 15 messages, triggers a structured save. Topics, decisions, quotes, code changes. Also regenerates the critical facts layer.
   516	
   517	**PreCompact Hook** — fires before context compression. Emergency save before the window shrinks.
   518	
   519	```json
   520	{
   521	  "hooks": {
   522	    "Stop": [{"matcher": "", "hooks": [{"type": "command", "command": "/path/to/mempalace/hooks/mempal_save_hook.sh"}]}],
   523	    "PreCompact": [{"matcher": "", "hooks": [{"type": "command", "command": "/path/to/mempalace/hooks/mempal_precompact_hook.sh"}]}]
   524	  }
   525	}
   526	```
   527	
   528	**Optional auto-ingest:** Set the `MEMPAL_DIR` environment variable to a directory path and the hooks will automatically run `mempalace mine` on that directory during each save trigger (background on stop, synchronous on precompact).

# Iteration 036: USER WORKFLOW IMPACT

## Focus
USER WORKFLOW IMPACT: How will adopted patterns change the agent developer experience? New commands, changed behaviors, migration guides needed.

## Findings
### Finding 1: Startup status becomes an operating contract, not just a health check
- **Source**: `external/mempalace/mcp_server.py` [SOURCE: external/mempalace/mcp_server.py:139-176], `external/README.md` [SOURCE: external/README.md:450-507], `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/context-server.ts` [SOURCE: .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/context-server.ts:755-788]
- **What it does**: MemPalace puts `PALACE_PROTOCOL` and `AAAK_SPEC` directly in `mempalace_status`, so the first status call teaches the agent to verify before answering, write diary entries after sessions, and invalidate changed facts.
- **Why it matters**: Public already emits startup guidance through server instructions and `session_bootstrap`; the portable pattern is stronger behavior guidance at bootstrap, not a brand-new command.
- **Recommendation**: adopt now
- **Impact**: high
- **Source strength**: primary

### Finding 2: Pre-compaction checkpointing is portable; periodic stop-hook blocking is not
- **Source**: `external/hooks/mempal_save_hook.sh` [SOURCE: external/hooks/mempal_save_hook.sh:4-12], [SOURCE: external/hooks/mempal_save_hook.sh:55-149], `external/hooks/mempal_precompact_hook.sh` [SOURCE: external/hooks/mempal_precompact_hook.sh:4-12], [SOURCE: external/hooks/mempal_precompact_hook.sh:40-76], `.opencode/plugins/spec-kit-compact-code-graph.js` [SOURCE: .opencode/plugins/spec-kit-compact-code-graph.js:396-414], `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/dist/memory/generate-context.js` [SOURCE: .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/dist/memory/generate-context.js:85-128]
- **What it does**: MemPalace blocks the AI every 15 user messages and always before compaction, pushing the agent to save decisions, quotes, code, and context; Public already has a compaction transport hook and a JSON-primary save authority.
- **Why it matters**: The best workflow fit for Public is a stronger compaction-time checkpoint using existing save surfaces, not a mandatory stop-hook interruption every N turns.
- **Recommendation**: adopt now
- **Impact**: high
- **Source strength**: primary

### Finding 3: `wake-up` plus onboarding would create a second recovery UX unless folded into `session_bootstrap`
- **Source**: `external/README.md` [SOURCE: external/README.md:111-169], `external/mempalace/layers.py` [SOURCE: external/mempalace/layers.py:8-16], [SOURCE: external/mempalace/layers.py:389-418], `external/mempalace/onboarding.py` [SOURCE: external/mempalace/onboarding.py:266-359], `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/context-server.ts` [SOURCE: .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/context-server.ts:770-788]
- **What it does**: MemPalace pairs interactive onboarding with generated bootstrap files and a `wake-up` command that injects L0+L1 context for local or non-MCP flows.
- **Why it matters**: Public already has `session_bootstrap` and `session_resume`; adding a parallel `wake-up` entrypoint would fragment operator docs and migration guidance unless it is just a profile or formatter on the existing recovery surface.
- **Recommendation**: prototype later
- **Impact**: high
- **Source strength**: primary

### Finding 4: Per-agent diaries add a real end-of-session ritual and role-local memory model
- **Source**: `external/mempalace/mcp_server.py` [SOURCE: external/mempalace/mcp_server.py:169-176], `external/README.md` [SOURCE: external/README.md:430-446], [SOURCE: external/README.md:500-507]
- **What it does**: The protocol tells agents to write diary entries after each session, and the diary tools keep separate role-specific histories like reviewer, architect, or ops.
- **Why it matters**: This would change the developer experience from one shared memory-save flow into optional per-role journaling; useful for specialist pattern recall, but risky if it competes with canonical session memory or becomes required ceremony.
- **Recommendation**: prototype later
- **Impact**: medium
- **Source strength**: primary

### Finding 5: Full wing/room taxonomy is mostly a metadata discipline and migration burden
- **Source**: `external/README.md` [SOURCE: external/README.md:60-72], `external/mempalace/cli.py` [SOURCE: external/mempalace/cli.py:11-20], [SOURCE: external/mempalace/cli.py:39-65], `external/mempalace/miner.py` [SOURCE: external/mempalace/miner.py:278-317], [SOURCE: external/mempalace/miner.py:325-365], `external/mempalace/palace_graph.py` [SOURCE: external/mempalace/palace_graph.py:5-15], [SOURCE: external/mempalace/palace_graph.py:33-95], [SOURCE: external/mempalace/palace_graph.py:161-210]
- **What it does**: MemPalace asks users to name wings and rooms, routes files into rooms by path/filename/keywords, and builds its navigation graph from shared room metadata.
- **Why it matters**: The repo’s own correction note says the “palace boost” is mostly metadata filtering; in Public, copying the full taxonomy would force new naming rules, onboarding, and migration docs without clearly beating existing retrieval authorities.
- **Recommendation**: reject
- **Impact**: medium
- **Source strength**: primary

### Finding 6: A temporal fact sidecar only works if it ships with explicit maintenance and repair guidance
- **Source**: `external/mempalace/knowledge_graph.py` [SOURCE: external/mempalace/knowledge_graph.py:1-15], [SOURCE: external/mempalace/knowledge_graph.py:52-88], [SOURCE: external/mempalace/knowledge_graph.py:121-190], [SOURCE: external/mempalace/knowledge_graph.py:282-338], `external/README.md` [SOURCE: external/README.md:482-490], `external/mempalace/cli.py` [SOURCE: external/mempalace/cli.py:529-545], `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/context-server.ts` [SOURCE: .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/context-server.ts:755-760]
- **What it does**: MemPalace keeps temporal facts in a separate SQLite KG with `add`, `invalidate`, `timeline`, and stats operations, alongside separate repair and migrate commands for storage maintenance.
- **Why it matters**: If Public later adds a temporal fact sidecar, developers will need explicit rules for when to add facts, when to invalidate them, and how to repair or migrate the store; this is not a transparent upgrade.
- **Recommendation**: prototype later
- **Impact**: medium
- **Source strength**: primary

## Assessment
- **New information ratio**: 0.20
- **Questions addressed**: startup/bootstrap UX, save/compaction behavior, onboarding and wake-up surfaces, diary ergonomics, taxonomy migration cost, temporal-sidecar operator burden
- **Questions answered**: keep `session_bootstrap` as the canonical recovery surface; adopt stronger compaction-time checkpointing without mandatory stop-hook blocking; avoid a standalone Public `wake-up` command for now; keep diaries optional and role-scoped if ever added; reject full palace taxonomy migration; treat temporal facts as a later sidecar with explicit ops docs
- **Novelty justification**: Earlier passes ranked the architecture choices; this pass translates them into concrete developer-facing behavior changes, command-surface implications, and migration requirements against current Public recovery/save authority.
- **Operational note**: `external/AGENTS.md` exists, and the exact validator command returned `RESULT: PASSED`, but the phase still inferred as Level 1 and emitted the temp-file warning under the read-only sandbox, so I could not persist iteration 036 into `research/research.md` or create closeout artifacts.

## Ruled Out
- A new top-level Public `wake-up` command as a parallel authority to `session_bootstrap`
- Mandatory every-N-turn stop-hook blocking as the default Public save behavior
- Full wing/hall/room taxonomy migration for the existing Public memory corpus
- Required per-agent diary writing as part of the core save contract

## Reflection
- **What worked**: Comparing MemPalace’s workflow claims directly against `context-server.ts`, `generate-context.js`, and the compact-code-graph compaction hook made the developer-experience impact concrete instead of architectural.
- **What did not work**: The read-only sandbox prevented appending this iteration to packet artifacts, and the validator still reports the temp-file warning plus Level-1 inference mismatch.
- **What I would do differently**: The next write-enabled pass should turn these findings into an operator-facing migration note with three sections: startup behavior changes, compaction/save behavior changes, and optional later surfaces.

## Recommended Next Focus
Translate the surviving workflow changes into rollout docs:
1. a bootstrap-hints patch that strengthens `session_bootstrap` guidance without adding a new command,
2. a compaction-checkpoint design that stays JSON-primary and non-blocking by default,
3. a migration guide that explicitly says what is *not* changing yet: no full taxonomy, no mandatory diary, no standalone wake-up command, no authoritative temporal sidecar.

- **Source**: `external/README.md` [SOURCE: external/README.md:111-169], `external/mempalace/layers.py` [SOURCE: external/mempalace/layers.py:8-16], [SOURCE: external/mempalace/layers.py:389-418], `external/mempalace/onboarding.py` [SOURCE: external/mempalace/onboarding.py:266-359], `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/context-server.ts` [SOURCE: .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/context-server.ts:770-788]
- **What it does**: MemPalace pairs interactive onboarding with generated bootstrap files and a `wake-up` command that injects L0+L1 context for local or non-MCP flows.
- **Why it matters**: Public already has `session_bootstrap` and `session_resume`; adding a parallel `wake-up` entrypoint would fragment operator docs and migration guidance unless it is just a profile or formatter on the existing recovery surface.
- **Recommendation**: prototype later
- **Impact**: high
- **Source strength**: primary

### Finding 4: Per-agent diaries add a real end-of-session ritual and role-local memory model
- **Source**: `external/mempalace/mcp_server.py` [SOURCE: external/mempalace/mcp_server.py:169-176], `external/README.md` [SOURCE: external/README.md:430-446], [SOURCE: external/README.md:500-507]
- **What it does**: The protocol tells agents to write diary entries after each session, and the diary tools keep separate role-specific histories like reviewer, architect, or ops.
- **Why it matters**: This would change the developer experience from one shared memory-save flow into optional per-role journaling; useful for specialist pattern recall, but risky if it competes with canonical session memory or becomes required ceremony.
- **Recommendation**: prototype later
- **Impact**: medium
- **Source strength**: primary

### Finding 5: Full wing/room taxonomy is mostly a metadata discipline and migration burden
- **Source**: `external/README.md` [SOURCE: external/README.md:60-72], `external/mempalace/cli.py` [SOURCE: external/mempalace/cli.py:11-20], [SOURCE: external/mempalace/cli.py:39-65], `external/mempalace/miner.py` [SOURCE: external/mempalace/miner.py:278-317], [SOURCE: external/mempalace/miner.py:325-365], `external/mempalace/palace_graph.py` [SOURCE: external/mempalace/palace_graph.py:5-15], [SOURCE: external/mempalace/palace_graph.py:33-95], [SOURCE: external/mempalace/palace_graph.py:161-210]
- **What it does**: MemPalace asks users to name wings and rooms, routes files into rooms by path/filename/keywords, and builds its navigation graph from shared room metadata.
- **Why it matters**: The repo’s own correction note says the “palace boost” is mostly metadata filtering; in Public, copying the full taxonomy would force new naming rules, onboarding, and migration docs without clearly beating existing retrieval authorities.
- **Recommendation**: reject
- **Impact**: medium
- **Source strength**: primary

### Finding 6: A temporal fact sidecar only works if it ships with explicit maintenance and repair guidance
- **Source**: `external/mempalace/knowledge_graph.py` [SOURCE: external/mempalace/knowledge_graph.py:1-15], [SOURCE: external/mempalace/knowledge_graph.py:52-88], [SOURCE: external/mempalace/knowledge_graph.py:121-190], [SOURCE: external/mempalace/knowledge_graph.py:282-338], `external/README.md` [SOURCE: external/README.md:482-490], `external/mempalace/cli.py` [SOURCE: external/mempalace/cli.py:529-545], `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/context-server.ts` [SOURCE: .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/context-server.ts:755-760]
- **What it does**: MemPalace keeps temporal facts in a separate SQLite KG with `add`, `invalidate`, `timeline`, and stats operations, alongside separate repair and migrate commands for storage maintenance.
- **Why it matters**: If Public later adds a temporal fact sidecar, developers will need explicit rules for when to add facts, when to invalidate them, and how to repair or migrate the store; this is not a transparent upgrade.
- **Recommendation**: prototype later
- **Impact**: medium
- **Source strength**: primary

## Assessment
- **New information ratio**: 0.20
- **Questions addressed**: startup/bootstrap UX, save/compaction behavior, onboarding and wake-up surfaces, diary ergonomics, taxonomy migration cost, temporal-sidecar operator burden
- **Questions answered**: keep `session_bootstrap` as the canonical recovery surface; adopt stronger compaction-time checkpointing without mandatory stop-hook blocking; avoid a standalone Public `wake-up` command for now; keep diaries optional and role-scoped if ever added; reject full palace taxonomy migration; treat temporal facts as a later sidecar with explicit ops docs
- **Novelty justification**: Earlier passes ranked the architecture choices; this pass translates them into concrete developer-facing behavior changes, command-surface implications, and migration requirements against current Public recovery/save authority.
- **Operational note**: `external/AGENTS.md` exists, and the exact validator command returned `RESULT: PASSED`, but the phase still inferred as Level 1 and emitted the temp-file warning under the read-only sandbox, so I could not persist iteration 036 into `research/research.md` or create closeout artifacts.

## Ruled Out
- A new top-level Public `wake-up` command as a parallel authority to `session_bootstrap`
- Mandatory every-N-turn stop-hook blocking as the default Public save behavior
- Full wing/hall/room taxonomy migration for the existing Public memory corpus
- Required per-agent diary writing as part of the core save contract

## Reflection
- **What worked**: Comparing MemPalace’s workflow claims directly against `context-server.ts`, `generate-context.js`, and the compact-code-graph compaction hook made the developer-experience impact concrete instead of architectural.
- **What did not work**: The read-only sandbox prevented appending this iteration to packet artifacts, and the validator still reports the temp-file warning plus Level-1 inference mismatch.
- **What I would do differently**: The next write-enabled pass should turn these findings into an operator-facing migration note with three sections: startup behavior changes, compaction/save behavior changes, and optional later surfaces.

## Recommended Next Focus
Translate the surviving workflow changes into rollout docs:
1. a bootstrap-hints patch that strengthens `session_bootstrap` guidance without adding a new command,
2. a compaction-checkpoint design that stays JSON-primary and non-blocking by default,
3. a migration guide that explicitly says what is *not* changing yet: no full taxonomy, no mandatory diary, no standalone wake-up command, no authoritative temporal sidecar.
