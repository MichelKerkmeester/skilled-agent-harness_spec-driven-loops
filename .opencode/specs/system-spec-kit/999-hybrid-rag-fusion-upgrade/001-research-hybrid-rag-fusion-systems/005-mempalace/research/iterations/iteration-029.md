## Assessment
- New information ratio: 0.41

## Recommended Next Focus
1. Measure Public queries by failure type: paraphrase miss, exact-anchor miss, temporal miss, and structural miss, then map each to the cheapest winning lane.
2. Prototype two narrow exactness boosters inside Public’s hybrid pipeline: quoted-phrase boost and named-entity boost, both telemetry-gated and benchmarked against current FTS/BM25 lanes.
3. Write an explicit routing contract: `memory_match_triggers` for exact/reactive cues, `memory_search` for semantic/open-ended recall, `code_graph_query` for structural questions, and taxonomy filters only as narrowing/boosting aids.

## Findings
### Finding 1: Hook-driven preservation can create blocking saves without proof that good data was actually preserved
- **Source**: [mempal_save_hook.sh](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/hooks/mempal_save_hook.sh#L129); [mempal_precompact_hook.sh](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/hooks/mempal_precompact_hook.sh#L64); [mcp_server.py](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/mcp_server.py#L326); [generate-context.js](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/dist/memory/generate-context.js#L85); [spec-kit-compact-code-graph.js](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/plugins/spec-kit-compact-code-graph.js#L396)
- **What it does**: MemPalace blocks every 15 user turns and always blocks before compaction, then tells the AI to save; optional auto-ingest is backgrounded in the stop hook and synchronous only if `MEMPAL_DIR` is configured. The write path itself is weakly protected: `mempalace_add_drawer` uses deterministic IDs, but it does not actually call the semantic duplicate checker before writing.
- **Why it matters for us**: If we copy this pattern into Public, the biggest failure mode is a false sense of safety: the runtime is interrupted, but preservation quality still depends on the model following instructions correctly. That can yield duplicated memories, noisy categorization, partial saves, or blocked UX with no durable improvement. Public’s current compaction transport and JSON-primary `generate-context.js` path are much more deterministic.
- **Recommendation**: prototype later
- **Impact**: high

/bin/zsh -lc 'rg -n "''^### Finding|''^## Findings|Recommendation|Impact|adopt now|prototype later|reject|NEW FEATURE" .opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/research/research.md' in /Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public
- **Why it matters**: This is pleasant for a solo hacker, but it creates configuration drift and harder debugging once multiple runtimes or operators are involved. Public’s JSON-primary save contract is the stronger pattern here: structured input, explicit target precedence, and validated error paths.
- **Recommendation**: reject
- **Impact**: high

### Finding 3: `status` is not just health output, it is an embedded operator playbook
- **Source**: [external/mempalace/mcp_server.py](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/mcp_server.py), [context-server.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/context-server.ts#L759)
- **What it does**: Source-confirmed. `mempalace_status` returns counts plus `PALACE_PROTOCOL` and `AAAK_SPEC`, so the first health call also teaches the agent when to search, verify, diary-write, and invalidate facts.
- **Why it matters**: This is a strong DX pattern. Public already injects startup instructions and session-recovery guidance, but MemPalace is more direct about memory-specific behavior. The thing to steal is the compact “how to use memory correctly” contract, not the palace framing or AAAK baggage.
- **Recommendation**: adopt now
- **Impact**: high

### Finding 4: Local debugging is better than average because there are concrete artifacts to inspect
- **Source**: [external/mempalace/mcp_server.py](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/mcp_server.py), [external/hooks/README.md](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/hooks/README.md), [external/mempalace/cli.py](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/cli.py), [context-server.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/context-server.ts#L1485)
- **What it does**: Source-confirmed. MemPalace logs MCP diagnostics to `stderr`, keeps a JSONL write-ahead log under `~/.mempalace/wal`, writes hook activity to `~/.mempalace/hook_state/hook.log`, and exposes explicit repair/migrate commands.
- **Why it matters**: This is worth copying. Public already does strong `stderr` startup reporting, but MemPalace’s WAL-plus-hook-log pattern is a very usable local forensic surface for “what wrote this memory and when?” and “why did a save trigger?”
- **Recommendation**: adopt now
- **Impact**: high

### Finding 5: Some important operational guarantees are opt-in or overstated, which weakens maintenance trust
- **Source**: [external/mempalace/mcp_server.py](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/mcp_server.py), [external/pyproject.toml](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/pyproject.toml), [external/tests/benchmarks/test_knowledge_graph_bench.py](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/tests/benchmarks/test_knowledge_graph_bench.py)
- **What it does**: Source-confirmed. `mempalace_add_drawer` says it “checks for duplicates first,” but the actual write path only guarantees deterministic-ID idempotency; the semantic duplicate check is a separate tool. Likewise, concurrent-writer coverage exists, but only in benchmark-marked tests excluded from the default pytest path.
- **Why it matters**: DX is not just convenience, it is trust. Public should keep doing the opposite here: make default paths match the promise, and keep critical safety checks in default validation rather than benchmark-only lanes.
- **Recommendation**: reject
- **Impact**: high

## Assessment
- New information ratio: 0.54

## Recommended Next Focus
Trace failure-path DX rather than happy-path DX: onboarding/mine/general-extractor error handling, missing-or-corrupt palace recovery, empty-search ergonomics, and whether the separate KG + hooks + Chroma surfaces create operator confusion under real breakage.

RESEARCH BRIEF:
# $refine TIDD-EC Prompt: 005-mempalace

## 2. Role

You are a research specialist in verbatim AI memory systems, ChromaDB-based semantic retrieval, navigable memory taxonomies, wake-up context layering, MCP tool design, hook-driven persistence, and local temporal knowledge graphs. Work like a systems analyst who can separate README positioning from verified Python mechanics, trace how MemPalace composes mining, storage, retrieval, hooks, and protocol guidance, and translate those choices into practical improvements for `Code_Environment/Public`.

## 3. Task

Research MemPalace's raw-verbatim memory architecture, palace taxonomy, wake-up stack, MCP protocol/tooling, hook-driven save flow, and temporal knowledge-graph patterns to identify practical, evidence-backed improvements for `Code_Environment/Public`, especially around session continuity, compaction survival, memory hygiene, and agent-facing recall ergonomics. Determine which MemPalace ideas should be `adopt now`, `prototype later`, or `reject`. Keep the analysis honest about what is source-confirmed, what is README-documented, and what is benchmark-claim territory.

## 4. Context

### 4.1 System Description

MemPalace is a local Python memory system centered on a strong design claim: keep raw conversation and project text instead of extracting only summarized facts, then make that verbatim corpus searchable and navigable. The external repo exposes a CLI, an MCP server, hook scripts, a ChromaDB-backed drawer store, a wake-up layering system, and a separate SQLite temporal knowledge graph. Its storage model uses palace terminology: wings for people/projects/topics, halls for shared memory categories, rooms for named ideas, closets for compact summaries, and drawers for original verbatim content.

The most important architectural tension in this phase is that MemPalace mixes strong implementation ideas with aggressive README claims that the project itself partially corrects in its April 7, 2026 note. The raw-verbatim result is the standout claim; AAAK is explicitly experimental and lossy; contradiction detection is documented as incomplete; and some benchmark or rerank claims live more in docs than in source. This phase should reward the underlying architecture where the code supports it, but it must not let benchmark marketing or future-looking README language blur the evidence line.

The repo appears to support three ingestion shapes into one shared memory backend: project mining, conversation mining, and a general heuristic extraction mode. Retrieval then spans direct semantic search, wake-up text generation across L0-L3 layers, palace graph traversal via shared room metadata, and MCP tooling that teaches an operational memory protocol to the agent through the status response itself. Hook scripts add another layer: instead of a memory system that only responds to explicit search/save calls, MemPalace also tries to shape the timing of memory writes at stop and pre-compact boundaries.

### 4.2 Cross-Phase Awareness Table

| Phase | System | Core Pattern | Overlap Risk | Differentiation |
|-------|--------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|
| 001 | Engram | MCP memory server (Go, SQLite+FTS5) | 005 (memory server), 004 (session continuity) | Focus tool profiles, session lifecycle, topic keys |
| 002 | Mex | Markdown scaffold + drift detection | 005 (project knowledge) | Focus drift detection, scaffold structure, no-DB approach |
| 003 | Modus Memory | FSRS spaced repetition + BM25 | 005 (local memory) | Focus FSRS decay, BM25, librarian expansion, cross-references |
| 004 | OpenCode Mnemosyne | Hybrid search (FTS5 + vector) | 005 (compaction, hybrid retrieval claims) | Focus plugin architecture, project/global scoping, wrapper boundary |
| 005 | MemPalace | Raw verbatim storage + palace taxonomy + hooks + temporal KG | 001 (MCP memory), 004 (compaction/helping memory survive), 003 (local memory) | Focus raw-no-extraction posture, wake-up layers, hooks, palace structure, temporal KG |

### 4.3 What This Repo Already Has

`Code_Environment/Public` already has Spec Kit Memory with hybrid retrieval, `memory_search`, `memory_context`, `memory_match_triggers`, memory-save flows through `generate-context.js`, session/bootstrap handling in the memory MCP server, and compaction-oriented structural transport via `.opencode/plugins/spec-kit-compact-code-graph.js`. It also already has semantic code search via CocoIndex and structured graph context via Compact Code Graph.

What it does **not** currently have is a raw-verbatim-by-default memory posture comparable to MemPalace's drawer model, a first-class wing/hall/room taxonomy for agent memory navigation, a dedicated L0/L1/L2/L3 wake-up stack for context loading, MemPalace-style stop/pre-compact save hooks that actively block to force preservation, or a separate temporal entity-triple knowledge graph with explicit invalidation alongside the main memory store. The comparison should stay anchored to those gaps rather than repeating generic hybrid-RAG analysis already covered elsewhere.

## 5. Instructions

1. Treat `/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace` as the pre-approved phase folder. Skip Gate 3, keep all writes inside this phase folder, and treat everything under `external/` as read-only.
2. Read the governing Public repo `AGENTS.md` first. Then explicitly verify whether `external/AGENTS.md` exists. If it does not, note that absence as evidence about repo scope rather than inventing external workflow constraints.
3. Before deep research begins, ensure this phase folder contains Level 3 Spec Kit docs: `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`, `checklist.md`, and `decision-record.md`.
4. Use `@speckit` for markdown authoring when the runtime supports agent routing. If routing is unavailable, preserve existing Spec Kit Level 3 structure manually without creating side-channel docs outside the phase folder.
5. Start with `external/README.md`, but read it critically. Cover these sections in order: the April 7, 2026 correction note; Quick Start; How You Actually Use It; The Palace; wake-up / AAAK sections; MCP tools; benchmark sections. Capture both the architecture claims and the repo's own admitted overstatements.
6. Immediately after the README, read `external/pyproject.toml` and `external/mempalace/cli.py`. Confirm the actual runtime boundary, command surface, install assumptions, and the core flows for `init`, `mine`, `search`, `wake-up`, `status`, `repair`, and `compress`.
7. Trace the MCP surface end to end in `external/mempalace/mcp_server.py`. Focus on tool registration, read/write split, stderr logging behavior, `PALACE_PROTOCOL`, `AAAK_SPEC`, status bootstrap behavior, duplicate checking, graph tools, knowledge-graph tools, diary tools, and what the tool names imply about agent discipline.
8. Trace retrieval and context loading next in `external/mempalace/searcher.py` and `external/mempalace/layers.py`. Capture the raw ChromaDB query path, wing/room filtering, L0/L1/L2/L3 layering, wake-up token assumptions, and how much of that layering is implementation versus README framing.
9. Trace structural navigation next in `external/mempalace/palace_graph.py` and `external/mempalace/knowledge_graph.py`. Keep these separate in your notes: palace graph traversal is metadata-derived from ChromaDB rooms/halls/wings, while the knowledge graph is a separate SQLite temporal triple store with invalidation.
10. Trace ingestion behavior next. Read `external/mempalace/miner.py`, `external/mempalace/convo_miner.py`, `external/mempalace/general_extractor.py`, and `external/mempalace/onboarding.py`. Focus on chunking strategy, room detection, no-summary posture, heuristic extraction, onboarding assumptions, and whether the system truly keeps everything or selectively restructures it during ingest.
11. Read hook and benchmark artifacts after the implementation core: `external/hooks/README.md`, `external/hooks/mempal_save_hook.sh`, `external/hooks/mempal_precompact_hook.sh`, and `external/benchmarks/BENCHMARKS.md`. Treat these as crucial to the product story, but distinguish carefully between executable behavior, experimental behavior, and benchmark claims that require caution.
12. Compare MemPalace directly against current `Code_Environment/Public` code: `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/handlers/memory-search.ts`, `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/context-server.ts`, `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/dist/memory/generate-context.js`, and `.opencode/plugins/spec-kit-compact-code-graph.js`. Be explicit about what Public already covers better and what MemPalace still contributes.
13. Before the main research pass, validate the phase folder with this exact command:
    ```bash
    cd /Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public && bash .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/spec/validate.sh "/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace" --strict
    ```
14. After validation passes, run `spec_kit:deep-research` with this exact topic:
    ```text
    Research the external repository at /Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external and identify concrete improvements for Code_Environment/Public, especially around raw verbatim memory storage, palace taxonomy (wings/halls/rooms), wake-up context layering, MCP protocol/tool design, hook-driven save flows, and temporal knowledge-graph patterns.
    ```
15. Save all outputs inside `research/`, with `research/research.md` as the canonical report. Every meaningful finding must cite exact file paths, say whether the evidence is `source-confirmed`, `README-documented`, `benchmark-documented`, or mixed, explain why it matters for `Code_Environment/Public`, classify the recommendation as `adopt now`, `prototype later`, or `reject`, identify the affected subsystem, and note migration or truthfulness risk. When research is complete, update `checklist.md`, create `implementation-summary.md`, and save memory with:
    ```bash
    cd /Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public && node .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/dist/memory/generate-context.js "/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace"
    ```

## 6. Research Questions

1. What does MemPalace gain from its raw-verbatim "store everything, then make it findable" posture, and where would that improve or conflict with Spec Kit Memory's more selective save and retrieval model?
2. How useful is the wing / hall / room / closet / drawer taxonomy in practice: does it materially improve navigation and recall, or does it mostly reframe metadata filtering in memorable language?
3. How does the L0/L1/L2/L3 wake-up stack compare with Public's `session_bootstrap`, `memory_context`, and compaction-recovery flows, and what parts of the layering model are reusable here?
4. What does `mcp_server.py` gain by embedding `PALACE_PROTOCOL` and `AAAK_SPEC` directly in the status bootstrap, and could Public benefit from similarly direct memory-usage guidance without adding prompt clutter?
5. How effective are the stop-hook and pre-compact-hook patterns at protecting context before loss, and how do they compare to Public's existing compaction-oriented structural plugin and memory-save workflows?
6. What are the real architectural consequences of keeping the temporal knowledge graph separate from the drawer store, especially around invalidation, diary entries, and fact-vs-verbatim boundaries?
7. How much of MemPalace's benchmark story is supported directly by code in this repo, and which claims should remain benchmark candidates or doc-level references rather than implementation truths?
8. How do `miner.py`, `convo_miner.py`, and `general_extractor.py` balance "store everything" against chunking, heuristics, room assignment, and extraction side paths?
9. Which MemPalace ideas most improve compaction survival and startup continuity for future Public sessions: wake-up layers, hook timing, memory protocol bootstrapping, diary writing, or taxonomy-based narrowing?
10. Which MemPalace features are genuinely reusable architecture, and which are presentation choices, experimental layers, or hype-prone claims that Public should not copy?
11. How should AAAK be evaluated honestly: as a useful optional compression dialect, a still-unproven context-loading experiment, or mostly a distraction from the stronger raw-verbatim baseline?

## 7. Do's

- Do distinguish raw verbatim storage from AAAK compression; they are not the same feature and do not have the same evidence quality.
- Do separate palace graph traversal from the temporal knowledge graph; one is metadata-derived navigation and the other is explicit fact storage with validity windows.
- Do inspect the actual hook scripts, not just their README, so the analysis captures the precise blocking behavior before save and compaction.
- Do compare MemPalace's wake-up flow against current Public bootstrap and compaction behavior using real Public files.
- Do treat the April 7, 2026 correction note as important evidence about truthfulness boundaries and product honesty.
- Do analyze how status/bootstrap responses teach the agent what to do, not just what data they return.
- Do map strong findings to specific Public subsystems such as Spec Kit Memory retrieval, context bootstrap, save flows, or compaction handling.

## 8. Don'ts

- Do not describe MemPalace as "just ChromaDB search"; the repo's differentiators are raw-storage posture, wake-up layers, hooks, taxonomy, and KG split.
- Do not treat README benchmark numbers as fully source-proven implementation facts unless the repo actually exposes the relevant pipeline.
- Do not recommend copying AAAK or benchmark marketing language wholesale into Public planning.
- Do not collapse this phase into generic hybrid-RAG analysis already owned by earlier phases.
- Do not ignore the repo's admitted inaccuracies or unresolved claims; they are central to evaluating whether an idea is production-worthy.
- Do not overlook the difference between "AI remembers because storage exists" and "AI remembers because the protocol tells it when and how to use storage."
- Do not edit anything under `external/` or outside this phase folder.

## 9. Examples

### Example A: Wake-up and protocol finding

```text
**Finding: Status doubles as a behavior bootstrap, not just a health check**
- Source: external/mempalace/mcp_server.py; external/mempalace/layers.py
- Evidence type: source-confirmed
- What it does: `mempalace_status` returns palace overview data plus `PALACE_PROTOCOL` and `AAAK_SPEC`, while the wake-up stack separately loads L0/L1 context for cheap startup continuity.
- Why it matters: Public already has resume/bootstrap tooling, but it does not currently use one memory-facing status surface to teach concrete retrieval and save behavior this directly.
- Recommendation: prototype later
- Affected area: memory bootstrap UX, session recovery guidance, compaction recovery behavior
- Risk/cost: Medium; could add prompt noise or duplicate existing guidance if not scoped carefully
```

### Example B: Hook-driven preservation finding

```text
**Finding: Save timing is enforced by hooks, not left to agent initiative alone**
- Source: external/hooks/mempal_save_hook.sh; external/hooks/mempal_precompact_hook.sh; external/hooks/README.md
- Evidence type: source-confirmed + README-documented
- What it does: the stop hook blocks every N human exchanges and the pre-compact hook always blocks, forcing the agent to preserve key context before loss.
- Why it matters: Public has compaction-oriented structural transport, but it does not currently enforce a comparable memory-preservation checkpoint before context collapse.
- Recommendation: adopt now or prototype later, depending on runtime surface
- Affected area: memory save automation, compaction resilience, agent operating protocol
- Risk/cost: Medium; intrusive save prompts and duplicate writes need guardrails
```

## 10. Constraints

### 10.1 Error handling

- If a README or benchmark claim is not directly supported by source, label it clearly as documentation- or benchmark-level evidence rather than implementation fact.
- If MemPalace's docs contradict its code or its own April 2026 correction note, prefer source evidence and call out the contradiction explicitly.
- If comparison assumptions about current `Code_Environment/Public` behavior are outdated, correct them in the research instead of preserving stale framing.
- If the external repo structure differs from the paths named here, preserve the same analytical order and document the actual files used.

### 10.2 Scope

**IN SCOPE**

- raw verbatim storage and no-summary posture
- palace taxonomy: wings, halls, rooms, closets, drawers
- L0/L1/L2/L3 wake-up layering
- MCP server design, status bootstrap, protocol guidance, diary tools
- stop and pre-compact hook behavior
- temporal knowledge graph and invalidation model
- mining modes, chunking, heuristics, onboarding
- benchmark and README truthfulness boundaries
- comparison against current Public memory, bootstrap, save, and compaction flows

**OUT OF SCOPE**

- generic Python style commentary
- speculative cloud scaling or hosted-service redesigns
- broad vector-database taxonomy disconnected from MemPalace evidence
- re-litigating BM25/FSRS/plugin topics already owned by earlier phases
- editing or fixing MemPalace itself

### 10.3 Prioritization framework

Rank findings in this order: leverage for Public session continuity, compaction-survival value, truthfulness and evidence quality, fit with current Spec Kit Memory capabilities, operational simplicity, memory-hygiene impact, and clean differentiation from phases `001` through `004`.

## 11. Deliverables

- `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`, `checklist.md`, and `decision-record.md` present and valid before deep research starts
- `research/research.md` as the canonical report with at least 5 evidence-backed findings
- explicit comparison against current Public memory retrieval, bootstrap, save, and compaction behavior
- each finding labeled `adopt now`, `prototype later`, or `reject`
- each finding states evidence type: `source-confirmed`, `README-documented`, `benchmark-documented`, or mixed
- `implementation-summary.md` created at the end
- memory saved from this phase folder using `generate-context.js`

Minimum finding schema:

- finding title
- exact source evidence
- evidence type
- what MemPalace does
- why it matters for `Code_Environment/Public`
- recommendation: `adopt now`, `prototype later`, or `reject`
- affected subsystem
- migration, ambiguity, or truthfulness risk

## 12. Evaluation Criteria

- CLEAR target: `>= 40/50`
- RICCE compliance is visible in the prompt:
  - **Role** is specialized in verbatim memory systems, wake-up layering, MCP protocol design, hooks, and temporal KG behavior
  - **Instructions** are ordered, concrete, path-specific, and honest about evidence boundaries
  - **Context** is domain-specific, cross-phase aware, and corrected for current Public capabilities
  - **Constraints** clearly separate source-confirmed behavior from README or benchmark claims
  - **Examples** show strong MemPalace-derived findings about protocol bootstrapping and hook-driven preservation
- at least 5 findings are evidence-backed rather than speculative
- findings explicitly separate raw-mode strengths from AAAK's experimental status
- findings compare MemPalace against today's Public bootstrap and compaction behavior rather than a stale baseline
- cross-phase overlap with `001` through `004` is explicitly bounded so this phase stays focused on raw-verbatim architecture, wake-up layers, hooks, and KG split

## 13. Completion Bar

The phase is only complete when all of the following are true:

- the reading order covered README honesty notes, CLI/runtime boundaries, MCP server, retrieval layers, palace graph, temporal KG, ingest pipeline, hooks, and benchmarks
- current `Code_Environment/Public` memory/bootstrap/compaction behavior was compared using code, not assumptions
- the validation command passed on this exact phase folder
- the exact deep-research topic string appears in the work
- `research/research.md` contains at least 5 evidence-backed findings
- each finding distinguishes source-confirmed behavior from README or benchmark claims where needed
- `checklist.md` is updated with evidence and completion marks
- `implementation-summary.md` exists
- memory is saved successfully for `005-mempalace`
- no edits were made outside this phase folder
- recommendations explicitly address raw storage, taxonomy, wake-up layering, hooks, and temporal KG patterns

Using `sk-deep-research` for this pass because the task is a focused architecture comparison over an external codebase slice. I’m starting with a quick memory pass and then I’ll verify the MemPalace implementation surfaces the brief calls out so the iteration stays evidence-backed.

# Autonomous Deep Research Loop

Iterative research protocol with fresh context per iteration, externalized state, and convergence detection for deep technical investigation.

Runtime path resolution:
- OpenCode/Copilot runtime: `.opencode/agent/*.md`
- Claude runtime: `.claude/agents/*.md`
- Codex runtime: `.codex/agents/*.toml`

<!-- ANCHOR:when-to-use -->
## 1. WHEN TO USE

### When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Deep investigation requiring multiple rounds of discovery
- Topic spans 3+ technical domains or sources
- Initial findings need progressive refinement
- Overnight or unattended research sessions
- Research where prior findings inform subsequent queries

### When NOT to Use

- Simple, single-question research (use direct codebase search or `/spec_kit:plan`)
- Known-solution documentation (use `/spec_kit:plan`)
- Implementation tasks (use `/spec_kit:implement`)
- Quick codebase searches (use `@context` or direct Grep/Glob)
- Fewer than 3 sources needed (single-pass research suffices)

### Keyword Triggers

`autoresearch`, `deep research`, `autonomous research`, `research loop`, `iterative research`, `multi-round research`, `deep investigation`, `comprehensive research`

For iterative code review and quality auditing, see `sk-deep-review`.

### Lifecycle Contract

Live lifecycle branches:
- `resume` — continue the active lineage
- `restart` — start a new generation with explicit parent linkage
- `fork` — branch from the current packet state
- `completed-continue` — reopen a completed lineage only after immutable synthesis snapshotting

### Core Innovation: Fresh Context Per Iteration

Each agent dispatch gets a fresh context window. State continuity comes from files, not memory. This solves context degradation in long research sessions.

Adapted from: karpathy/autoresearch (loop concept), AGR (fresh context "Ralph Loop"), pi-autoresearch (JSONL state), autoresearch-opencode (context injection).

### Data Flow

```
Init --> Create config.json, strategy.md, state.jsonl
  |
Loop --> Read state --> Check convergence --> Dispatch @deep-research
  |                                              |
  |                                              v
  |                                         Agent executes:
  |                                         1. Read state files
  |                                         2. Determine focus
  |                                         3. Research (3-5 actions)
  |                                         4. Write iteration-NNN.md
  |                                         5. Update strategy.md
  |                                         6. Append state.jsonl
  |                                              |
  +<--- Evaluate results <-----------------------+
  |
  +--- Continue? --> Yes: next iteration
  |                  No: exit loop
  v
Synthesize --> Compile final research/research.md
  |
Save --> generate-context.js --> verify memory artifact
```

### Key Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Externalized state** | All research continuity via files, not agent memory |
| **Fresh context** | Each iteration gets a clean agent with no prior context |
| **Convergence** | Multi-signal detection: newInfoRatio, stuck count, questions answered |
| **Strategy file** | Reducer-synchronized research steering with machine-owned sections |
| **JSONL log** | Append-only structured log for lineage and iteration data |
| **Findings registry** | Reducer-owned open/resolved questions, key findings, and ruled-out directions |

I’ve got the research workflow and prior memory hit. Next I’m reading the exact MemPalace surfaces behind taxonomy, wake-up layers, hooks, and the separate knowledge graph, then I’ll map those decisions directly onto our current memory/bootstrap stack.
Focused read-only deep-research pass for iteration 29: extract architecture decisions from MemPalace, compare to Public, and synthesize adopt/prototype/reject calls.
  → Inspect prior memory notes and the current phase research context for MemPalace-specific cues
  • Read MemPalace source surfaces for architecture decisions: MCP server, retrieval/layers, taxonomy graph, knowledge graph, ingestion, hooks
  • Read corresponding Public memory/bootstrap/save/compaction files for comparison
  • Synthesize an architecture decision record with recommendations and impact

## 2. Role

You are a research specialist in verbatim AI memory systems, ChromaDB-based semantic retrieval, navigable memory taxonomies, wake-up context layering, MCP tool design, hook-driven persistence, and local temporal knowledge graphs. Work like a systems analyst who can separate README positioning from verified Python mechanics, trace how MemPalace composes mining, storage, retrieval, hooks, and protocol guidance, and translate those choices into practical improvements for `Code_Environment/Public`.

## 3. Task

Research MemPalace's raw-verbatim memory architecture, palace taxonomy, wake-up stack, MCP protocol/tooling, hook-driven save flow, and temporal knowledge-graph patterns to identify practical, evidence-backed improvements for `Code_Environment/Public`, especially around session continuity, compaction survival, memory hygiene, and agent-facing recall ergonomics. Determine which MemPalace ideas should be `adopt now`, `prototype later`, or `reject`. Keep the analysis honest about what is source-confirmed, what is README-documented, and what is benchmark-claim territory.

## 4. Context

### 4.1 System Description

MemPalace is a local Python memory system centered on a strong design claim: keep raw conversation and project text instead of extracting only summarized facts, then make that verbatim corpus searchable and navigable. The external repo exposes a CLI, an MCP server, hook scripts, a ChromaDB-backed drawer store, a wake-up layering system, and a separate SQLite temporal knowledge graph. Its storage model uses palace terminology: wings for people/projects/topics, halls for shared memory categories, rooms for named ideas, closets for compact summaries, and drawers for original verbatim content.

The most important architectural tension in this phase is that MemPalace mixes strong implementation ideas with aggressive README claims that the project itself partially corrects in its April 7, 2026 note. The raw-verbatim result is the standout claim; AAAK is explicitly experimental and lossy; contradiction detection is documented as incomplete; and some benchmark or rerank claims live more in docs than in source. This phase should reward the underlying architecture where the code supports it, but it must not let benchmark marketing or future-looking README language blur the evidence line.

The repo appears to support three ingestion shapes into one shared memory backend: project mining, conversation mining, and a general heuristic extraction mode. Retrieval then spans direct semantic search, wake-up text generation across L0-L3 layers, palace graph traversal via shared room metadata, and MCP tooling that teaches an operational memory protocol to the agent through the status response itself. Hook scripts add another layer: instead of a memory system that only responds to explicit search/save calls, MemPalace also tries to shape the timing of memory writes at stop and pre-compact boundaries.

### 4.2 Cross-Phase Awareness Table

| Phase | System | Core Pattern | Overlap Risk | Differentiation |
|-------|--------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|
| 001 | Engram | MCP memory server (Go, SQLite+FTS5) | 005 (memory server), 004 (session continuity) | Focus tool profiles, session lifecycle, topic keys |
| 002 | Mex | Markdown scaffold + drift detection | 005 (project knowledge) | Focus drift detection, scaffold structure, no-DB approach |
| 003 | Modus Memory | FSRS spaced repetition + BM25 | 005 (local memory) | Focus FSRS decay, BM25, librarian expansion, cross-references |
| 004 | OpenCode Mnemosyne | Hybrid search (FTS5 + vector) | 005 (compaction, hybrid retrieval claims) | Focus plugin architecture, project/global scoping, wrapper boundary |
| 005 | MemPalace | Raw verbatim storage + palace taxonomy + hooks + temporal KG | 001 (MCP memory), 004 (compaction/helping memory survive), 003 (local memory) | Focus raw-no-extraction posture, wake-up layers, hooks, palace structure, temporal KG |

### 4.3 What This Repo Already Has

`Code_Environment/Public` already has Spec Kit Memory with hybrid retrieval, `memory_search`, `memory_context`, `memory_match_triggers`, memory-save flows through `generate-context.js`, session/bootstrap handling in the memory MCP server, and compaction-oriented structural transport via `.opencode/plugins/spec-kit-compact-code-graph.js`. It also already has semantic code search via CocoIndex and structured graph context via Compact Code Graph.

What it does **not** currently have is a raw-verbatim-by-default memory posture comparable to MemPalace's drawer model, a first-class wing/hall/room taxonomy for agent memory navigation, a dedicated L0/L1/L2/L3 wake-up stack for context loading, MemPalace-style stop/pre-compact save hooks that actively block to force preservation, or a separate temporal entity-triple knowledge graph with explicit invalidation alongside the main memory store. The comparison should stay anchored to those gaps rather than repeating generic hybrid-RAG analysis already covered elsewhere.

## 5. Instructions

1. Treat `/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace` as the pre-approved phase folder. Skip Gate 3, keep all writes inside this phase folder, and treat everything under `external/` as read-only.
2. Read the governing Public repo `AGENTS.md` first. Then explicitly verify whether `external/AGENTS.md` exists. If it does not, note that absence as evidence about repo scope rather than inventing external workflow constraints.
3. Before deep research begins, ensure this phase folder contains Level 3 Spec Kit docs: `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`, `checklist.md`, and `decision-record.md`.
4. Use `@speckit` for markdown authoring when the runtime supports agent routing. If routing is unavailable, preserve existing Spec Kit Level 3 structure manually without creating side-channel docs outside the phase folder.
5. Start with `external/README.md`, but read it critically. Cover these sections in order: the April 7, 2026 correction note; Quick Start; How You Actually Use It; The Palace; wake-up / AAAK sections; MCP tools; benchmark sections. Capture both the architecture claims and the repo's own admitted overstatements.
6. Immediately after the README, read `external/pyproject.toml` and `external/mempalace/cli.py`. Confirm the actual runtime boundary, command surface, install assumptions, and the core flows for `init`, `mine`, `search`, `wake-up`, `status`, `repair`, and `compress`.
7. Trace the MCP surface end to end in `external/mempalace/mcp_server.py`. Focus on tool registration, read/write split, stderr logging behavior, `PALACE_PROTOCOL`, `AAAK_SPEC`, status bootstrap behavior, duplicate checking, graph tools, knowledge-graph tools, diary tools, and what the tool names imply about agent discipline.
8. Trace retrieval and context loading next in `external/mempalace/searcher.py` and `external/mempalace/layers.py`. Capture the raw ChromaDB query path, wing/room filtering, L0/L1/L2/L3 layering, wake-up token assumptions, and how much of that layering is implementation versus README framing.
9. Trace structural navigation next in `external/mempalace/palace_graph.py` and `external/mempalace/knowledge_graph.py`. Keep these separate in your notes: palace graph traversal is metadata-derived from ChromaDB rooms/halls/wings, while the knowledge graph is a separate SQLite temporal triple store with invalidation.
10. Trace ingestion behavior next. Read `external/mempalace/miner.py`, `external/mempalace/convo_miner.py`, `external/mempalace/general_extractor.py`, and `external/mempalace/onboarding.py`. Focus on chunking strategy, room detection, no-summary posture, heuristic extraction, onboarding assumptions, and whether the system truly keeps everything or selectively restructures it during ingest.
11. Read hook and benchmark artifacts after the implementation core: `external/hooks/README.md`, `external/hooks/mempal_save_hook.sh`, `external/hooks/mempal_precompact_hook.sh`, and `external/benchmarks/BENCHMARKS.md`. Treat these as crucial to the product story, but distinguish carefully between executable behavior, experimental behavior, and benchmark claims that require caution.
12. Compare MemPalace directly against current `Code_Environment/Public` code: `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/handlers/memory-search.ts`, `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/context-server.ts`, `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/dist/memory/generate-context.js`, and `.opencode/plugins/spec-kit-compact-code-graph.js`. Be explicit about what Public already covers better and what MemPalace still contributes.
13. Before the main research pass, validate the phase folder with this exact command:
    ```bash
    cd /Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public && bash .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/spec/validate.sh "/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace" --strict
    ```
14. After validation passes, run `spec_kit:deep-research` with this exact topic:
    ```text
    Research the external repository at /Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external and identify concrete improvements for Code_Environment/Public, especially around raw verbatim memory storage, palace taxonomy (wings/halls/rooms), wake-up context layering, MCP protocol/tool design, hook-driven save flows, and temporal knowledge-graph patterns.
    ```
15. Save all outputs inside `research/`, with `research/research.md` as the canonical report. Every meaningful finding must cite exact file paths, say whether the evidence is `source-confirmed`, `README-documented`, `benchmark-documented`, or mixed, explain why it matters for `Code_Environment/Public`, classify the recommendation as `adopt now`, `prototype later`, or `reject`, identify the affected subsystem, and note migration or truthfulness risk. When research is complete, update `checklist.md`, create `implementation-summary.md`, and save memory with:
    ```bash
    cd /Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public && node .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/dist/memory/generate-context.js "/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace"
    ```

## 6. Research Questions

1. What does MemPalace gain from its raw-verbatim "store everything, then make it findable" posture, and where would that improve or conflict with Spec Kit Memory's more selective save and retrieval model?
2. How useful is the wing / hall / room / closet / drawer taxonomy in practice: does it materially improve navigation and recall, or does it mostly reframe metadata filtering in memorable language?
3. How does the L0/L1/L2/L3 wake-up stack compare with Public's `session_bootstrap`, `memory_context`, and compaction-recovery flows, and what parts of the layering model are reusable here?
4. What does `mcp_server.py` gain by embedding `PALACE_PROTOCOL` and `AAAK_SPEC` directly in the status bootstrap, and could Public benefit from similarly direct memory-usage guidance without adding prompt clutter?
5. How effective are the stop-hook and pre-compact-hook patterns at protecting context before loss, and how do they compare to Public's existing compaction-oriented structural plugin and memory-save workflows?
6. What are the real architectural consequences of keeping the temporal knowledge graph separate from the drawer store, especially around invalidation, diary entries, and fact-vs-verbatim boundaries?
7. How much of MemPalace's benchmark story is supported directly by code in this repo, and which claims should remain benchmark candidates or doc-level references rather than implementation truths?
8. How do `miner.py`, `convo_miner.py`, and `general_extractor.py` balance "store everything" against chunking, heuristics, room assignment, and extraction side paths?
9. Which MemPalace ideas most improve compaction survival and startup continuity for future Public sessions: wake-up layers, hook timing, memory protocol bootstrapping, diary writing, or taxonomy-based narrowing?
10. Which MemPalace features are genuinely reusable architecture, and which are presentation choices, experimental layers, or hype-prone claims that Public should not copy?
11. How should AAAK be evaluated honestly: as a useful optional compression dialect, a still-unproven context-loading experiment, or mostly a distraction from the stronger raw-verbatim baseline?

## 7. Do's

- Do distinguish raw verbatim storage from AAAK compression; they are not the same feature and do not have the same evidence quality.
- Do separate palace graph traversal from the temporal knowledge graph; one is metadata-derived navigation and the other is explicit fact storage with validity windows.
- Do inspect the actual hook scripts, not just their README, so the analysis captures the precise blocking behavior before save and compaction.
- Do compare MemPalace's wake-up flow against current Public bootstrap and compaction behavior using real Public files.
- Do treat the April 7, 2026 correction note as important evidence about truthfulness boundaries and product honesty.
- Do analyze how status/bootstrap responses teach the agent what to do, not just what data they return.
- Do map strong findings to specific Public subsystems such as Spec Kit Memory retrieval, context bootstrap, save flows, or compaction handling.

## 8. Don'ts

- Do not describe MemPalace as "just ChromaDB search"; the repo's differentiators are raw-storage posture, wake-up layers, hooks, taxonomy, and KG split.
- Do not treat README benchmark numbers as fully source-proven implementation facts unless the repo actually exposes the relevant pipeline.
- Do not recommend copying AAAK or benchmark marketing language wholesale into Public planning.
- Do not collapse this phase into generic hybrid-RAG analysis already owned by earlier phases.
- Do not ignore the repo's admitted inaccuracies or unresolved claims; they are central to evaluating whether an idea is production-worthy.
- Do not overlook the difference between "AI remembers because storage exists" and "AI remembers because the protocol tells it when and how to use storage."
- Do not edit anything under `external/` or outside this phase folder.

## 9. Examples

### Example A: Wake-up and protocol finding

```text
**Finding: Status doubles as a behavior bootstrap, not just a health check**
- Source: external/mempalace/mcp_server.py; external/mempalace/layers.py
- Evidence type: source-confirmed
- What it does: `mempalace_status` returns palace overview data plus `PALACE_PROTOCOL` and `AAAK_SPEC`, while the wake-up stack separately loads L0/L1 context for cheap startup continuity.
- Why it matters: Public already has resume/bootstrap tooling, but it does not currently use one memory-facing status surface to teach concrete retrieval and save behavior this directly.
- Recommendation: prototype later
- Affected area: memory bootstrap UX, session recovery guidance, compaction recovery behavior
- Risk/cost: Medium; could add prompt noise or duplicate existing guidance if not scoped carefully
```

### Example B: Hook-driven preservation finding

```text
**Finding: Save timing is enforced by hooks, not left to agent initiative alone**
- Source: external/hooks/mempal_save_hook.sh; external/hooks/mempal_precompact_hook.sh; external/hooks/README.md
- Evidence type: source-confirmed + README-documented
- What it does: the stop hook blocks every N human exchanges and the pre-compact hook always blocks, forcing the agent to preserve key context before loss.
- Why it matters: Public has compaction-oriented structural transport, but it does not currently enforce a comparable memory-preservation checkpoint before context collapse.
- Recommendation: adopt now or prototype later, depending on runtime surface
- Affected area: memory save automation, compaction resilience, agent operating protocol
- Risk/cost: Medium; intrusive save prompts and duplicate writes need guardrails
```

## 10. Constraints

### 10.1 Error handling

- If a README or benchmark claim is not directly supported by source, label it clearly as documentation- or benchmark-level evidence rather than implementation fact.
- If MemPalace's docs contradict its code or its own April 2026 correction note, prefer source evidence and call out the contradiction explicitly.
- If comparison assumptions about current `Code_Environment/Public` behavior are outdated, correct them in the research instead of preserving stale framing.
- If the external repo structure differs from the paths named here, preserve the same analytical order and document the actual files used.

### 10.2 Scope

**IN SCOPE**

- raw verbatim storage and no-summary posture
- palace taxonomy: wings, halls, rooms, closets, drawers
- L0/L1/L2/L3 wake-up layering
- MCP server design, status bootstrap, protocol guidance, diary tools
- stop and pre-compact hook behavior
- temporal knowledge graph and invalidation model
- mining modes, chunking, heuristics, onboarding
- benchmark and README truthfulness boundaries
- comparison against current Public memory, bootstrap, save, and compaction flows

**OUT OF SCOPE**

- generic Python style commentary
- speculative cloud scaling or hosted-service redesigns
- broad vector-database taxonomy disconnected from MemPalace evidence
- re-litigating BM25/FSRS/plugin topics already owned by earlier phases
- editing or fixing MemPalace itself

### 10.3 Prioritization framework

Rank findings in this order: leverage for Public session continuity, compaction-survival value, truthfulness and evidence quality, fit with current Spec Kit Memory capabilities, operational simplicity, memory-hygiene impact, and clean differentiation from phases `001` through `004`.

## 11. Deliverables

- `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`, `checklist.md`, and `decision-record.md` present and valid before deep research starts
- `research/research.md` as the canonical report with at least 5 evidence-backed findings
- explicit comparison against current Public memory retrieval, bootstrap, save, and compaction behavior
- each finding labeled `adopt now`, `prototype later`, or `reject`
- each finding states evidence type: `source-confirmed`, `README-documented`, `benchmark-documented`, or mixed
- `implementation-summary.md` created at the end
- memory saved from this phase folder using `generate-context.js`

Minimum finding schema:

- finding title
- exact source evidence
- evidence type
- what MemPalace does
- why it matters for `Code_Environment/Public`
- recommendation: `adopt now`, `prototype later`, or `reject`
- affected subsystem
- migration, ambiguity, or truthfulness risk

## 12. Evaluation Criteria

- CLEAR target: `>= 40/50`
- RICCE compliance is visible in the prompt:
  - **Role** is specialized in verbatim memory systems, wake-up layering, MCP protocol design, hooks, and temporal KG behavior
  - **Instructions** are ordered, concrete, path-specific, and honest about evidence boundaries
  - **Context** is domain-specific, cross-phase aware, and corrected for current Public capabilities
  - **Constraints** clearly separate source-confirmed behavior from README or benchmark claims
  - **Examples** show strong MemPalace-derived findings about protocol bootstrapping and hook-driven preservation
- at least 5 findings are evidence-backed rather than speculative
- findings explicitly separate raw-mode strengths from AAAK's experimental status
- findings compare MemPalace against today's Public bootstrap and compaction behavior rather than a stale baseline
- cross-phase overlap with `001` through `004` is explicitly bounded so this phase stays focused on raw-verbatim architecture, wake-up layers, hooks, and KG split

## 13. Completion Bar

The phase is only complete when all of the following are true:

- the reading order covered README honesty notes, CLI/runtime boundaries, MCP server, retrieval layers, palace graph, temporal KG, ingest pipeline, hooks, and benchmarks
- current `Code_Environment/Public` memory/bootstrap/compaction behavior was compared using code, not assumptions
- the validation command passed on this exact phase folder
- the exact deep-research topic string appears in the work
- `research/research.md` contains at least 5 evidence-backed findings
- each finding distinguishes source-confirmed behavior from README or benchmark claims where needed
- `checklist.md` is updated with evidence and completion marks
- `implementation-summary.md` exists
- memory is saved successfully for `005-mempalace`
- no edits were made outside this phase folder
- recommendations explicitly address raw storage, taxonomy, wake-up layering, hooks, and temporal KG patterns

codex
I’m treating this as a read-only deep research pass over the `005-mempalace` phase and its `external/` source, with the goal of mapping MemPalace’s architecture against Public’s current memory stack. I’m starting by checking the phase folder shape, confirming whether `external/AGENTS.md` exists, and loading the deep-research guidance plus the key source entry points before I trace data flow.
exec

codex
One useful correction already surfaced: `external/AGENTS.md` is present, so I’m reading that instead of assuming the external tree is unconstrained. Now I’m pulling the architecture-relevant symbols and sections across MemPalace and our matching Public files so the ADR can stay grounded in code rather than README framing.

7:### The highest-scoring AI memory system ever benchmarked. And it's free.
15:**The Palace** — Ancient Greek orators memorized entire speeches by placing ideas in rooms of an imaginary building. Walk through the building, find the idea. MemPalace applies the same principle to AI memory: your conversations are organized into wings (people and projects), halls (types of memory), and rooms (specific ideas). No AI decides what matters — you keep every word, and the structure gives you a navigable map instead of a flat search index.
19:**AAAK (experimental)** — A lossy abbreviation dialect for packing repeated entities into fewer tokens at scale. Readable by any LLM that reads text — Claude, GPT, Gemini, Llama, Mistral — no decoder needed. **AAAK is a separate compression layer, not the storage default**, and on the LongMemEval benchmark it currently regresses vs raw mode (84.2% vs 96.6%). We're iterating. See the [note above](#a-note-from-milla--ben--april-7-2026) for the honest status.
32:[Quick Start](#quick-start) · [The Palace](#the-palace) · [AAAK Dialect](#aaak-dialect-experimental) · [Benchmarks](#benchmarks) · [MCP Tools](#mcp-server)
46:<sub>Reproducible — runners in <a href="benchmarks/">benchmarks/</a>. <a href="benchmarks/BENCHMARKS.md">Full results</a>. The 96.6% is from <b>raw verbatim mode</b>, not AAAK or rooms mode (those score lower — see <a href="#a-note-from-milla--ben--april-7-2026">note above</a>).</sub>
52:## A Note from Milla & Ben — April 7, 2026
58:> - **The AAAK token example was incorrect.** We used a rough heuristic (`len(text)//3`) for token counts instead of an actual tokenizer. Real counts via OpenAI's tokenizer: the English example is 66 tokens, the AAAK example is 73. AAAK does not save tokens at small scales — it's designed for *repeated entities at scale*, and the README example was a bad demonstration of that. We're rewriting it.
60:> - **"30x lossless compression" was overstated.** AAAK is a lossy abbreviation system (entity codes, sentence truncation). Independent benchmarks show AAAK mode scores **84.2% R@5 vs raw mode's 96.6%** on LongMemEval — a 12.4 point regression. The honest framing is: AAAK is an experimental compression layer that trades fidelity for token density, and **the 96.6% headline number is from RAW mode, not AAAK**.
66:> - **"100% with Haiku rerank"** is real (we have the result files) but the rerank pipeline is not in the public benchmark scripts. We're adding it.
76:> 1. Rewriting the AAAK example with real tokenizer counts and a scenario where AAAK actually demonstrates compression
77:> 2. Adding `mode raw / aaak / rooms` clearly to the benchmark documentation so the trade-offs are visible
79:> 4. Pinning ChromaDB to a tested range (Issue #100), fixing the shell injection in hooks (#110), and addressing the macOS ARM64 segfault (#74)
87:## Quick Start
104:mempalace status
111:## How You Actually Use It
139:MemPalace also works natively with **Gemini CLI** (which handles the server and save hooks automatically) — see the [Gemini CLI Integration Guide](examples/gemini_cli_setup.md).
148:mempalace wake-up > context.txt
152:This gives your local model ~170 tokens of critical facts (in AAAK if you prefer) before you ask a single question.
169:Either way — your entire memory stack runs offline. ChromaDB on your machine, Llama on your machine, AAAK for compression, zero cloud calls.
183:| **MemPalace wake-up** | **~170 tokens** | **~$0.70/yr** |
186:MemPalace loads 170 tokens of critical facts on wake-up — your team, your projects, your preferences. Then searches only when needed. $10/year to remember everything vs $507/year for summaries that lose context.
192:### The Palace
200:Every room has a **closet** connected to it, and here's where things get interesting. We've developed an AI language called **AAAK**. Don't ask — it's a whole story of its own. Your agent learns the AAAK shorthand every time it wakes up. Because AAAK is essentially English, but a very truncated version, your agent understands how to use it in seconds. It comes as part of the install, built into the MemPalace code. In our next update, we'll add AAAK directly to the closets, which will be a real game changer — the amount of info in the closets will be much bigger, but it will take up far less space and far less reading time for your agent.
202:Inside those closets are **drawers**, and those drawers are where your original files live. In this first version, we haven't used AAAK as a closet tool, but even so, the summaries have shown **96.6% recall** in all the benchmarks we've done across multiple benchmarking platforms. Once the closets use AAAK, searches will be even faster while keeping every word exact. But even now, the closet approach has been a huge boon to how much info is stored in a small space — it's used to easily point your AI agent to the drawer where your original file lives. You never lose anything, and all this happens in seconds.
242:**Closets** — summaries that point to the original content. (In v3.0.0 these are plain-text summaries; AAAK-encoded closets are coming in a future update — see [Task #30](https://github.com/milla-jovovich/mempalace/issues/30).)
280:| **L1** | Critical facts — team, projects, preferences | ~120 tokens (AAAK) | Always loaded |
286:### AAAK Dialect (experimental)
288:AAAK is a lossy abbreviation system — entity codes, structural markers, and sentence truncation — designed to pack repeated entities and relationships into fewer tokens at scale. It is **readable by any LLM that reads text** (Claude, GPT, Gemini, Llama, Mistral) without a decoder, so a local model can use it without any cloud dependency.
290:**Honest status (April 2026):**
292:- **AAAK is lossy, not lossless.** It uses regex-based abbreviation, not reversible compression.
293:- **It does not save tokens at small scales.** Short text already tokenizes efficiently. AAAK overhead (codes, separators) costs more than it saves on a few sentences.
295:- **AAAK currently regresses LongMemEval** vs raw verbatim retrieval (84.2% R@5 vs 96.6%). The 96.6% headline number is from **raw mode**, not AAAK mode.
296:- **The MemPalace storage default is raw verbatim text in ChromaDB** — that's where the benchmark wins come from. AAAK is a separate compression layer for context loading, not the storage format.
431:- **Keeps a diary** — written in AAAK, persists across sessions
441:# → last 10 findings, compressed in AAAK
467:| `mempalace_status` | Palace overview + AAAK spec + memory protocol |
473:| `mempalace_get_aaak_spec` | AAAK dialect reference |
504:| `mempalace_diary_write` | Write AAAK diary entry |
507:The AI learns AAAK and the memory protocol automatically from the `mempalace_status` response. No manual configuration.
513:Two hooks for Claude Code that automatically save memories during work:
521:  "hooks": {
522:    "Stop": [{"matcher": "", "hooks": [{"type": "command", "command": "/path/to/mempalace/hooks/mempal_save_hook.sh"}]}],
523:    "PreCompact": [{"matcher": "", "hooks": [{"type": "command", "command": "/path/to/mempalace/hooks/mempal_precompact_hook.sh"}]}]
528:**Optional auto-ingest:** Set the `MEMPAL_DIR` environment variable to a directory path and the hooks will automatically run `mempalace mine` on that directory during each save trigger (background on stop, synchronous on precompact).
534:Tested on standard academic benchmarks — reproducible, published datasets.

.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/benchmarks/BENCHMARKS.md:18:That's the finding. The field is over-engineering the memory extraction step. Raw verbatim text with good embeddings is a stronger baseline than anyone realized — because it doesn't lose information. When an LLM extracts "user prefers PostgreSQL" and throws away the original conversation, it loses the context of *why*, the alternatives considered, the tradeoffs discussed. MemPal keeps all of that, and the search model finds it.

When it extracts the wrong thing, the memory is gone. MemPal stores verbatim text. Nothing is discarded. The simpler approach wins because it doesn't lose information.

Adversarial score (92.8%) exceeds bge-large overall (92.4%) — speaker ownership almost completely solves the speaker-confusion category.

.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/benchmarks/BENCHMARKS.md:231:**Why it worked:** Preference questions are consistently hard for pure embedding retrieval. "What does the user prefer for database backends?" doesn't semantically match "I find Postgres more reliable in my experience" — but it does match a synthetic document that says "User has mentioned: finds Postgres more reliable." The explicit extraction bridges the vocabulary gap without losing the verbatim original.

I’m drilling into the write path, chunking/routing, hook blocking behavior, and Public’s startup/save contract now so the adopt/reject calls stay specific.

     9	| **Save Hook** | Every 15 human messages | Blocks the AI, tells it to save key topics/decisions/quotes to the palace |
    10	| **PreCompact Hook** | Right before context compaction | Emergency save — forces the AI to save EVERYTHING before losing context |
    11	
    12	The AI does the actual filing — it knows the conversation context, so it classifies memories into the right wings/halls/closets. The hooks just tell it WHEN to save.

    35	    }]
    36	  }
    37	}
    38	```
    39	
    40	Make them executable:
    41	```bash
    42	chmod +x hooks/mempal_save_hook.sh hooks/mempal_precompact_hook.sh
    43	```
    44	
    45	## Install — Codex CLI (OpenAI)
    46	
    47	Add to `.codex/hooks.json`:
    48	
    49	```json
    50	{
    51	  "Stop": [{
    52	    "type": "command",
    53	    "command": "/absolute/path/to/hooks/mempal_save_hook.sh",
    54	    "timeout": 30
    55	  }],

    59	    "timeout": 30
    60	  }]
    61	}
    62	```
    63	
    64	## Configuration
    65	
    66	Edit `mempal_save_hook.sh` to change:
    67	
    68	- **`SAVE_INTERVAL=15`** — How many human messages between saves. Lower = more frequent saves, higher = less interruption.
    69	- **`STATE_DIR`** — Where hook state is stored (defaults to `~/.mempalace/hook_state/`)
    70	- **`MEMPAL_DIR`** — Optional. Set to a conversations directory to auto-run `mempalace mine <dir>` on each save trigger. Leave blank (default) to let the AI handle saving via the block reason message.
    71	
    72	### mempalace CLI
    73	
    74	The relevant commands are:
    75	
    76	```bash
    77	mempalace mine <dir>               # Mine all files in a directory
    78	mempalace mine <dir> --mode convos # Mine conversation transcripts only
    79	```
    80	
    81	The hooks resolve the repo root automatically from their own path, so they work regardless of where you install the repo.
    82	
    83	## How It Works (Technical)
    84	
    85	### Save Hook (Stop event)
    86	
    87	```
    88	User sends message → AI responds → Claude Code fires Stop hook
    89	                                            ↓
    90	                                    Hook counts human messages in JSONL transcript
    91	                                            ↓
    92	                              ┌─── < 15 since last save ──→ echo "{}" (let AI stop)
    93	                              │
    94	                              └─── ≥ 15 since last save ──→ {"decision": "block", "reason": "save..."}
    95	                                                                    ↓
    96	                                                            AI saves to palace
    97	                                                                    ↓
    98	                                                            AI tries to stop again
    99	                                                                    ↓
   100	                                                            stop_hook_active = true
   101	                                                                    ↓
   102	                                                            Hook sees flag → echo "{}" (let it through)
   103	```
   104	
   105	The `stop_hook_active` flag prevents infinite loops: block once → AI saves → tries to stop → flag is true → we let it through.
   106	
   107	### PreCompact Hook
   108	
   109	```
   110	Context window getting full → Claude Code fires PreCompact
   111	                                        ↓
   112	                                Hook ALWAYS blocks
   113	                                        ↓
   114	                                AI saves everything
   115	                                        ↓
   116	                                Compaction proceeds
   117	```
   118	
   119	No counting needed — compaction always warrants a save.
   120	
   121	## Debugging
   122	
   123	Check the hook log:
   124	```bash
   125	cat ~/.mempalace/hook_state/hook.log
   126	```
   127	
   128	Example output:
   129	```
   130	[14:30:15] Session abc123: 12 exchanges, 12 since last save
   131	[14:35:22] Session abc123: 15 exchanges, 15 since last save
   132	[14:35:22] TRIGGERING SAVE at exchange 15
   133	[14:40:01] Session abc123: 18 exchanges, 3 since last save
   134	```
   135	
   136	## Cost
   137	
   138	**Zero extra tokens.** The hooks are bash scripts that run locally. They don't call any API. The only "cost" is the AI spending a few seconds organizing memories at each checkpoint — and it's doing that with context it already has loaded.

     1	# MemPal Benchmark Results — Full Progression
     2	
     3	**March 2026 — The complete record from baseline to state-of-the-art.**
     4	
     5	---
     6	
     7	## The Core Finding
     8	
     9	Every competitive memory system uses an LLM to manage memory:
    10	- Mem0 uses an LLM to extract facts
    11	- Mastra uses GPT-5-mini to observe conversations
    12	- Supermemory uses an LLM to run agentic search passes
    13	
    14	They all start from the assumption that you need AI to decide what to remember.
    15	
    16	**MemPal's baseline just stores the actual words and searches them with ChromaDB's default embeddings. No extraction. No summarization. No AI deciding what matters. And it scores 96.6% on LongMemEval.**
    17	
    18	That's the finding. The field is over-engineering the memory extraction step. Raw verbatim text with good embeddings is a stronger baseline than anyone realized — because it doesn't lose information. When an LLM extracts "user prefers PostgreSQL" and throws away the original conversation, it loses the context of *why*, the alternatives considered, the tradeoffs discussed. MemPal keeps all of that, and the search model finds it.
    19	
    20	Nobody published this result because nobody tried the simple thing and measured it properly.
    21	
    22	---
    23	
    24	## The Two Honest Numbers
    25	
    26	These are different claims. They need to be presented as a pair.
    27	
    28	| Mode | LongMemEval R@5 | LLM Required | Cost per Query |
    29	|---|---|---|---|
    30	| **Raw ChromaDB** | **96.6%** | None | $0 |
    31	| **Hybrid v4 + Haiku rerank** | **100%** | Haiku (optional) | ~$0.001 |
    32	| **Hybrid v4 + Sonnet rerank** | **100%** | Sonnet (optional) | ~$0.003 |
    33	
    34	The 96.6% is the product story: free, private, one dependency, no API key, runs entirely offline.
    35	
    36	The 100% is the competitive story: a perfect score on the standard benchmark for AI memory, verified across all 500 questions and all 6 question types — reproducible with either Haiku or Sonnet as the reranker.
    37	
    38	Both are real. Both are reproducible. Neither is the whole picture alone.
    39	
    40	---
    41	
    42	## Comparison vs Published Systems (LongMemEval)
    43	
    44	| # | System | R@5 | LLM Required | Which LLM | Notes |
    45	|---|---|---|---|---|---|
    46	| 1 | **MemPal (hybrid v4 + rerank)** | **100%** | Optional | Haiku | Reproducible, 500/500 |
    47	| 2 | Supermemory ASMR | ~99% | Yes | Undisclosed | Research only, not in production |
    48	| 3 | MemPal (hybrid v3 + rerank) | 99.4% | Optional | Haiku | Reproducible |
    49	| 3 | MemPal (palace + rerank) | 99.4% | Optional | Haiku | Independent architecture |
    50	| 4 | Mastra | 94.87% | Yes | GPT-5-mini | — |
    51	| 5 | **MemPal (raw, no LLM)** | **96.6%** | **None** | **None** | **Highest zero-API score published** |
    52	| 6 | Hindsight | 91.4% | Yes | Gemini-3 | — |
    53	| 7 | Supermemory (production) | ~85% | Yes | Undisclosed | — |
    54	| 8 | Stella (dense retriever) | ~85% | None | None | Academic baseline |
    55	| 9 | Contriever | ~78% | None | None | Academic baseline |
    56	| 10 | BM25 (sparse) | ~70% | None | None | Keyword baseline |
    57	
    58	**MemPal raw (96.6%) is the highest published LongMemEval score that requires no API key, no cloud, and no LLM at any stage.**
    59	
    60	**MemPal hybrid v4 + Haiku rerank (100%) is the first perfect score on LongMemEval — 500/500 questions, all 6 question types at 100%.**

    64	## Other Benchmarks
    65	
    66	### ConvoMem (Salesforce, 75K+ QA pairs)
    67	
    68	| System | Score | Notes |
    69	|---|---|---|
    70	| **MemPal** | **92.9%** | Verbatim text, semantic search |
    71	| Gemini (long context) | 70–82% | Full history in context window |
    72	| Block extraction | 57–71% | LLM-processed blocks |
    73	| Mem0 (RAG) | 30–45% | LLM-extracted memories |
    74	
    75	MemPal is more than 2× Mem0 on this benchmark. With Sonnet rerank, MemPal reaches **100% on LoCoMo** across all 5 question types including temporal-inference (was 46% at baseline).
    76	
    77	**Why MemPal beats Mem0 by 2×:** Mem0 uses an LLM to extract memories — it decides what to remember and discards the rest. When it extracts the wrong thing, the memory is gone. MemPal stores verbatim text. Nothing is discarded. The simpler approach wins because it doesn't lose information.
    78	
    79	**Per-category breakdown:**

    84	| User Facts | 98.0% | Excellent |
    85	| Abstention | 91.0% | Strong |
    86	| Implicit Connections | 89.3% | Good |
    87	| Preferences | 86.0% | Good — weakest category |

    93	| **Hybrid v5 + Sonnet rerank (top-50)** | **100%** | **100%** | Sonnet | Structurally guaranteed (top-k > sessions) |
    94	| **bge-large + Haiku rerank (top-15)** | — | **96.3%** | Haiku | Single-hop 86.6%, temporal-inf 87.0% |
    95	| **bge-large hybrid (top-10)** | — | **92.4%** | None | +3.5pp over all-MiniLM, single-hop +10.6pp |
    96	| **Hybrid v5 (top-10)** | 83.7% | **88.9%** | None | Beats Memori 81.95% — honest score |
    97	| **Wings v3 speaker-owned closets (top-10)** | — | **85.7%** | None | Adversarial 92.8% — speaker ownership solves speaker confusion |
    98	| **Wings v2 concept closets (top-10)** | — | **75.6%** | None | Adversarial 80.0%; single-hop 49% drags overall |
    99	| **Palace v2 (top-10, 3 rooms)** | 75.6% | **84.8%** | Haiku (index) | Room assignment at index; summary routing at query |
   100	| Wings v1 (broken — filter not boost) | — | 58.0% | None | Speaker WHERE filter discarded evidence; 5.4% coverage |
   101	| Palace v1 (top-5, global LLM routing) | 34.2% | — | Haiku (both) | Fails: taxonomy mismatch |
   102	| Session, no rerank (top-10) | — | 60.3% | None | Baseline |
   103	| Dialog, no rerank (top-10) | — | 48.0% | None | — |
   104	
   105	**Wings v2 per-category breakdown (top-10, no LLM):**
   106	
   107	| Category | Wings v1 | Wings v2 | Delta |
   108	|---|---|---|---|
   109	| Single-hop | ~52% | 49.0% | -3pp |
   110	| Temporal | ~64% | 79.2% | +15pp |
   111	| Temporal-inference | ~53% | 49.1% | -4pp |
   112	| Open-domain | ~71% | 83.7% | +13pp |
   113	| **Adversarial** | **34.0%** | **80.0%** | **+46pp** |
   114	
   115	**Wings v3 per-category breakdown (top-10, no LLM):**
   116	
   117	| Category | Wings v1 | Wings v2 | Wings v3 | Hybrid v5 |
   118	|---|---|---|---|---|
   119	| Single-hop | ~52% | 49.0% | **65.3%** | ~70%? |
   120	| Temporal | ~64% | 79.2% | **87.3%** | ~87%? |
   121	| Temporal-inference | ~53% | 49.1% | **63.2%** | ~65%? |
   122	| Open-domain | ~71% | 83.7% | **90.7%** | ~90%? |
   123	| **Adversarial** | **34.0%** | **80.0%** | **92.8%** | — |
   124	
   125	Wings v3 design: one closet per speaker per session. Owner's turns verbatim; other speaker's turns as `[context]` labels. 38 closets/conversation vs 184 (v2) → 26% coverage with top-10. Adversarial score (92.8%) exceeds bge-large overall (92.4%) — speaker ownership almost completely solves the speaker-confusion category.
   126	
   127	Root cause of wings v1 failure: (1) speaker WHERE filter discarded evidence about Caroline when evidence lived in a John-tagged closet (John spoke more words but conversation was about Caroline); (2) top_k=10 from ~184 closets = 5.4% coverage vs 37% in session mode. Fix: retrieve all closets, use speaker match as 15% distance boost instead of filter.
   128	
   129	**With Sonnet rerank, MemPal achieves 100% on every LoCoMo question type — including temporal-inference, which was the hardest category at baseline.**
   130	
   131	**Per-category breakdown (hybrid + Sonnet rerank):**
   132	
   133	| Category | Recall | Baseline | Delta |
   134	|---|---|---|---|
   135	| Single-hop | 1.000 | 59.0% | +41.0pp |
   136	| Temporal | 1.000 | 69.2% | +30.8pp |
   137	| **Temporal-inference** | **1.000** | **46.0%** | **+54.0pp** |
   138	| Open-domain | 1.000 | 58.1% | +41.9pp |
   139	| Adversarial | 1.000 | 61.9% | +38.1pp |
   140	
   141	**Temporal-inference was the hardest category** — questions requiring connections across multiple sessions. Hybrid scoring (person name boost, quoted phrase boost) combined with Sonnet's reading comprehension closes this gap entirely. From 46% to 100%.
   142

   145	## LongMemEval — Breakdown by Question Type
   146	
   147	The 96.6% R@5 baseline broken down by the six question categories in LongMemEval:
   148	
   149	| Question Type | R@5 | R@10 | Count | Notes |
   150	|---|---|---|---|---|
   151	| Knowledge update | 99.0% | 100% | 78 | Strongest — facts that changed over time |
   152	| Multi-session | 98.5% | 100% | 133 | Very strong |
   153	| Temporal reasoning | 96.2% | 97.0% | 133 | Strong |
   154	| Single-session user | 95.7% | 97.1% | 70 | Strong |
   155	| Single-session preference | 93.3% | 96.7% | 30 | Good — preferences stated indirectly |
   156	| Single-session assistant | 92.9% | 96.4% | 56 | Weakest — questions about what the AI said |
   157	
   158	The two weakest categories point to specific fixes:
   159	- **Single-session assistant (92.9%)**: Questions ask about what the assistant said, not the user. Fixed by indexing assistant turns as well as user turns.
   160	- **Single-session preference (93.3%)**: Preferences are often stated indirectly ("I usually prefer X"). Fixed by the preference extraction patterns in hybrid v3.
   161	
   162	Both were addressed in the improvements that took the score from 96.6% to 99.4%.
   163	
   164	---
   165	
   166	## The Full Progression — How We Got from 96.6% to 99.4%
   167	
   168	Every improvement below was a response to specific failure patterns in the results. Nothing was added speculatively.
   169	
   170	### Starting Point: Raw ChromaDB (96.6%)
   171	
   172	The baseline: store every session verbatim as a single document. Query with ChromaDB's default embeddings (all-MiniLM-L6-v2). No postprocessing.
   173	
   174	This was the first result. Nobody expected it to work this well. The team's hypothesis was that raw verbatim storage would lose to systems that extract structured facts. The 96.6% proved the hypothesis wrong.
   175	
   176	**What it does:** Stores verbatim session text. Embeds with sentence transformers. Retrieves by cosine similarity.
   177	
   178	**What it misses:** Questions with vocabulary mismatch ("yoga classes" vs "I went this morning"), preference questions where the preference is implied, temporally-ambiguous questions where multiple sessions match.
   179	
   180	---
   181	
   182	### Improvement 1: Hybrid Scoring v1 → 97.8% (+1.2%)
   183	
   184	**What changed:** Added keyword overlap scoring on top of embedding similarity.
   185	
   186	```
   187	fused_score = embedding_score × (1 + keyword_weight × overlap)
   188	```
   189	
   190	When query keywords appear verbatim in a session, that session gets a small boost. The boost is mild enough not to hurt recall when keywords don't match.
   191	
   192	**Why it worked:** Some questions use exact terminology ("PostgreSQL", "Dr. Chen", specific names). Pure embedding similarity can rank a semantically-close session above the exact match. Keyword overlap rescues these cases.
   193	
   194	**What it still misses:** Temporally-ambiguous questions. Sessions from the right time period rank equally with sessions from wrong time periods.
   195

   198	### Improvement 2: Hybrid Scoring v2 → 98.4% (+0.6%)
   199	
   200	**What changed:** Added temporal boost — sessions near the question's reference date get a distance reduction (up to 40%).
   201	
   202	```python
   203	# Sessions near question_date - offset get score boost
   204	if temporal_distance < threshold:
   205	    fused_dist *= (1.0 - temporal_boost * proximity_factor)
   206	```
   207	
   208	**Why it worked:** Many LongMemEval questions are anchored to a specific time ("what did you do last month?"). Multiple sessions might semantically match, but only one is temporally correct. The boost breaks ties in favor of the right time period.
   209	
   210	---
   211	
   212	### Improvement 3: Hybrid v2 + Haiku Rerank → 98.8% (+0.4%)
   213	
   214	**What changed:** After retrieval, send the top-K candidates to Claude Haiku with the question. Ask Haiku to re-rank by relevance.
   215	
   216	**Why it worked:** Embeddings measure semantic similarity, not answer relevance. Haiku can read the question and the retrieved documents and reason about which one actually answers the question — a task embeddings fundamentally cannot do.
   217	
   218	**Cost:** ~$0.001/query for Haiku. Optional — the system runs fine without it.
   219	
   220	---
   221	
   222	### Improvement 4: Hybrid v3 + Haiku Rerank → 99.4% (+0.6%)
   223	
   224	**What changed:** Added preference extraction — 16 regex patterns that detect how people actually express preferences in conversation, then create synthetic "User has mentioned: X" documents at index time.
   225	
   226	Examples of what gets caught:
   227	- "I usually prefer X" → `User has mentioned: preference for X`
   228	- "I always do Y" → `User has mentioned: always does Y`
   229	- "I don't like Z" → `User has mentioned: dislikes Z`
   230	
   231	**Why it worked:** Preference questions are consistently hard for pure embedding retrieval. "What does the user prefer for database backends?" doesn't semantically match "I find Postgres more reliable in my experience" — but it does match a synthetic document that says "User has mentioned: finds Postgres more reliable." The explicit extraction bridges the vocabulary gap without losing the verbatim original.
   232	
   233	**Why 16 patterns:** Manual analysis of the miss cases. Each pattern corresponds to a real failure mode found in the wrong-answer JSONL files.
   234	
   235	---
   236	
   237	### Improvement 5: Hybrid v4 + Haiku Rerank → **100%** (+0.6%)
   238	
   239	**What changed:** Three targeted fixes for the three questions that failed in every previous mode.

    62	Usage: node generate-context.js [options] <input>
    63	
    64	Arguments:
    65	  <input>           A JSON data file path
    66	                    - JSON file mode: node generate-context.js data.json [spec-folder]
    67	
    68	Options:
    69	  --help, -h        Show this help message
    70	  --stdin           Read structured JSON from stdin (preferred when a caller already has curated session data)
    71	  --json <string>   Read structured JSON from an inline string (preferred when structured data is available)
    72	  --session-id <uuid>  Explicit session ID to attach to the saved memory metadata
    73	
    74	Examples:
    75	  node generate-context.js /tmp/context-data.json
    76	  node generate-context.js /tmp/context-data.json specs/001-feature/
    77	  node generate-context.js /tmp/context-data.json .opencode/specs/001-feature/
    78	  echo '{"specFolder":"specs/001-feature/"}' | node generate-context.js --stdin
    79	  node generate-context.js --json '{"specFolder":"specs/001-feature/"}'
    80	
    81	Output:
    82	  Creates a memory file in <spec-folder>/memory/ with ANCHOR format
    83	  for indexing by the Spec Kit Memory system.
    84	
    85	Preferred save path (JSON-PRIMARY):
    86	  - ALWAYS use --stdin, --json, or a JSON temp file.
    87	  - The AI has strictly better information about its own session than any DB query can reconstruct.
    88	  - Explicit CLI targets still outrank payload specFolder values in every structured-input mode.
    89	
    90	Direct CLI target rule:
    91	  - When a spec folder is passed on the CLI, that explicit target is authoritative.
    92	  - Session learning, JSON SPEC_FOLDER fields, and auto-detect may inform logging,
    93	    but they must not reroute the save to another folder.
    94	
    95	JSON Data Format (with preflight/postflight, session/git, and tool/exchange enrichment):
    96	  {
    97	    "user_prompts": [...],

    54	> The community caught real problems in this README within hours of launch and we want to address them directly.
    55	>
    56	> **What we got wrong:**
    57	>
    58	> - **The AAAK token example was incorrect.** We used a rough heuristic (`len(text)//3`) for token counts instead of an actual tokenizer. Real counts via OpenAI's tokenizer: the English example is 66 tokens, the AAAK example is 73. AAAK does not save tokens at small scales — it's designed for *repeated entities at scale*, and the README example was a bad demonstration of that. We're rewriting it.
    59	>
    60	> - **"30x lossless compression" was overstated.** AAAK is a lossy abbreviation system (entity codes, sentence truncation). Independent benchmarks show AAAK mode scores **84.2% R@5 vs raw mode's 96.6%** on LongMemEval — a 12.4 point regression. The honest framing is: AAAK is an experimental compression layer that trades fidelity for token density, and **the 96.6% headline number is from RAW mode, not AAAK**.
    61	>
    62	> - **"+34% palace boost" was misleading.** That number compares unfiltered search to wing+room metadata filtering. Metadata filtering is a standard ChromaDB feature, not a novel retrieval mechanism. Real and useful, but not a moat.
    63	>
    64	> - **"Contradiction detection"** exists as a separate utility (`fact_checker.py`) but is not currently wired into the knowledge graph operations as the README implied.
    65	>
    66	> - **"100% with Haiku rerank"** is real (we have the result files) but the rerank pipeline is not in the public benchmark scripts. We're adding it.
    67	>
    68	> **What's still true and reproducible:**
    69	>
    70	> - **96.6% R@5 on LongMemEval in raw mode**, on 500 questions, zero API calls — independently reproduced on M2 Ultra in under 5 minutes by [@gizmax](https://github.com/milla-jovovich/mempalace/issues/39).
    71	> - Local, free, no subscription, no cloud, no data leaving your machine.
    72	> - The architecture (wings, rooms, closets, drawers) is real and useful, even if it's not a magical retrieval boost.
    73	>
    74	> **What we're doing:**
    75	>
    76	> 1. Rewriting the AAAK example with real tokenizer counts and a scenario where AAAK actually demonstrates compression
    77	> 2. Adding `mode raw / aaak / rooms` clearly to the benchmark documentation so the trade-offs are visible
    78	> 3. Wiring `fact_checker.py` into the KG ops so the contradiction detection claim becomes true
    79	> 4. Pinning ChromaDB to a tested range (Issue #100), fixing the shell injection in hooks (#110), and addressing the macOS ARM64 segfault (#74)
    80	>

   192	### The Palace
   193	
   194	The layout is fairly simple, though it took a long time to get there.
   195	
   196	It starts with a **wing**. Every project, person, or topic you're filing gets its own wing in the palace.
   197	
   198	Each wing has **rooms** connected to it, where information is divided into subjects that relate to that wing — so every room is a different element of what your project contains. Project ideas could be one room, employees could be another, financial statements another. There can be an endless number of rooms that split the wing into sections. The MemPalace install detects these for you automatically, and of course you can personalize it any way you feel is right.
   199	
   200	Every room has a **closet** connected to it, and here's where things get interesting. We've developed an AI language called **AAAK**. Don't ask — it's a whole story of its own. Your agent learns the AAAK shorthand every time it wakes up. Because AAAK is essentially English, but a very truncated version, your agent understands how to use it in seconds. It comes as part of the install, built into the MemPalace code. In our next update, we'll add AAAK directly to the closets, which will be a real game changer — the amount of info in the closets will be much bigger, but it will take up far less space and far less reading time for your agent.
   201	
   202	Inside those closets are **drawers**, and those drawers are where your original files live. In this first version, we haven't used AAAK as a closet tool, but even so, the summaries have shown **96.6% recall** in all the benchmarks we've done across multiple benchmarking platforms. Once the closets use AAAK, searches will be even faster while keeping every word exact. But even now, the closet approach has been a huge boon to how much info is stored in a small space — it's used to easily point your AI agent to the drawer where your original file lives. You never lose anything, and all this happens in seconds.
   203	
   204	There are also **halls**, which connect rooms within a wing, and **tunnels**, which connect rooms from different wings to one another. So finding things becomes truly effortless — we've given the AI a clean and organized way to know where to start searching, without having to look through every keyword in huge folders.
   205	
   206	You say what you're looking for and boom, it already knows which wing to go to. Just *that* in itself would have made a big difference. But this is beautiful, elegant, organic, and most importantly, efficient.

   238	**Wings** — a person or project. As many as you need.
   239	**Rooms** — specific topics within a wing. Auth, billing, deploy — endless rooms.
   240	**Halls** — connections between related rooms *within* the same wing. If Room A (auth) and Room B (security) are related, a hall links them.
   241	**Tunnels** — connections *between* wings. When Person A and a Project both have a room about "auth," a tunnel cross-references them automatically.
   242	**Closets** — summaries that point to the original content. (In v3.0.0 these are plain-text summaries; AAAK-encoded closets are coming in a future update — see [Task #30](https://github.com/milla-jovovich/mempalace/issues/30).)
   243	**Drawers** — the original verbatim files. The exact words, never summarized.
   244	
   245	**Halls** are memory types — the same in every wing, acting as corridors:
   246	- `hall_facts` — decisions made, choices locked in

   511	## Auto-Save Hooks
   512	
   513	Two hooks for Claude Code that automatically save memories during work:
   514	
   515	**Save Hook** — every 15 messages, triggers a structured save. Topics, decisions, quotes, code changes. Also regenerates the critical facts layer.
   516	
   517	**PreCompact Hook** — fires before context compression. Emergency save before the window shrinks.
   518	
   519	```json
   520	{
   521	  "hooks": {
   522	    "Stop": [{"matcher": "", "hooks": [{"type": "command", "command": "/path/to/mempalace/hooks/mempal_save_hook.sh"}]}],
   523	    "PreCompact": [{"matcher": "", "hooks": [{"type": "command", "command": "/path/to/mempalace/hooks/mempal_precompact_hook.sh"}]}]
   524	  }
   525	}
   526	```
   527	
   528	**Optional auto-ingest:** Set the `MEMPAL_DIR` environment variable to a directory path and the hooks will automatically run `mempalace mine` on that directory during each save trigger (background on stop, synchronous on precompact).
   529

The decision set is stable now: MemPalace’s strongest ideas are protocol bootstrapping, metadata-guided narrowing, auditability, and a clean fact-store split; its weakest bets are forced AI-driven save hooks and AAAK-heavy compression claims. I’m wrapping this into the iteration report with direct adopt/prototype/reject calls for Public.
  ✓ Inspect prior memory notes and the current phase research context for MemPalace-specific cues
  ✓ Read MemPalace source surfaces for architecture decisions: MCP server, retrieval/layers, taxonomy graph, knowledge graph, ingestion, hooks
  ✓ Read corresponding Public memory/bootstrap/save/compaction files for comparison
  ✓ Synthesize an architecture decision record with recommendations and impact

# Iteration 029: ARCHITECTURE DECISION RECORD

## Focus
ARCHITECTURE DECISION RECORD: Document the key architectural decisions this system made and why. Which decisions should we adopt and which should we reject?

## Findings
### Finding 1: Keep verbatim evidence as the authority, then add narrower retrieval views on top
- **Source**: [miner.py](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/miner.py#L3), [searcher.py](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/searcher.py#L21), [BENCHMARKS.md](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/benchmarks/BENCHMARKS.md#L16), [generate-context.js](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/dist/memory/generate-context.js#L85)
- **What it does**: Source-confirmed. MemPalace mines files into verbatim drawer chunks with no summary-first reduction, then searches those drawers directly. Its strongest benchmark claims are explicitly tied to raw mode, not AAAK. Public already makes the same truthfulness move on save input: structured JSON is authoritative and should not be reconstructed later.
- **Why it matters**: This is the right architectural center of gravity. Public should not become raw-everything-by-default, but it should preserve more verbatim evidence for high-value decisions, quotes, and failure context instead of forcing every useful memory into a compressed abstraction.
- **Recommendation**: adopt now
- **Impact**: high

### Finding 2: Taxonomy is useful as a metadata routing overlay, not as a distinct retrieval engine
- **Source**: [README.md](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/README.md#L62), [README.md](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/README.md#L192), [searcher.py](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/searcher.py#L34), [palace_graph.py](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/palace_graph.py#L33)
- **What it does**: Mixed evidence. The README correction explicitly says the “palace boost” was really wing/room metadata filtering, and the code matches that: search is standard Chroma where-filters, while the palace graph is derived from existing metadata rather than a separate retrieval stack.
- **Why it matters**: Public should adopt the honest version of this decision. Taxonomy can help narrow search scope, explain navigation, and surface cross-domain bridges, but it should stay a post-routing precision aid rather than a new “third lane” beside semantic and lexical retrieval.
- **Recommendation**: adopt now
- **Impact**: medium

### Finding 3: Status should teach the agent how to use memory, not just report health
- **Source**: [mcp_server.py](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/mcp_server.py#L139), [mcp_server.py](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/mcp_server.py#L169), [context-server.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/context-server.ts#L741)
- **What it does**: Source-confirmed. `mempalace_status` returns counts plus `PALACE_PROTOCOL` and `AAAK_SPEC`, so the first health call also trains behavior: verify before speaking, write a diary after sessions, invalidate stale facts. Public already computes startup instructions and recovery guidance, but it is broader and less memory-protocol-specific.
- **Why it matters**: This is one of MemPalace’s best decisions. Public should add a compact, explicit memory-usage contract to bootstrap/status surfaces so agents are reminded when to search, when to trust structure, and when to save.
- **Recommendation**: adopt now
- **Impact**: high

### Finding 4: A cheap wake-up stack is reusable, but not as a replacement for Public’s stronger resume/bootstrap flow
- **Source**: [layers.py](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/layers.py#L3), [layers.py](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/layers.py#L76), [layers.py](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/layers.py#L389), [context-server.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/context-server.ts#L764)
- **What it does**: Source-confirmed. MemPalace splits startup into L0 identity text, L1 top-drawer summary, L2 filtered recall, and L3 deep search. The implementation is simpler than the README framing suggests: L1 is just top-weight drawer snippets grouped by room, not a sophisticated session-recovery model.
- **Why it matters**: Public already has the more robust recovery spine with `session_bootstrap`, `session_resume`, and structural freshness checks. The reusable part is the idea of a tiny, cheap “wake-up brief” for hot starts, not the whole MemPalace layering model as a new source of truth.
- **Recommendation**: prototype later
- **Impact**: medium

### Finding 5: Keep mutable facts in a separate temporal store with explicit invalidation
- **Source**: [knowledge_graph.py](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/knowledge_graph.py#L1), [knowledge_graph.py](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/knowledge_graph.py#L56), [knowledge_graph.py](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/knowledge_graph.py#L121), [knowledge_graph.py](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/knowledge_graph.py#L180)
- **What it does**: Source-confirmed. MemPalace keeps facts in a separate SQLite WAL-backed graph with `valid_from`/`valid_to`, `source_closet`, and explicit invalidation, instead of trying to force mutable facts into the same substrate as verbatim drawers.
- **Why it matters**: This separation is architecturally sound. Public already has causal links and graph-aware retrieval, but not a true temporal fact store. A narrow temporal sidecar for changed facts, identities, and state transitions would reduce ambiguity without contaminating the main memory corpus.
- **Recommendation**: prototype later
- **Impact**: high

### Finding 6: Strong forensic surfaces are worth copying; forced hook-blocking saves are not
- **Source**: [mcp_server.py](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/mcp_server.py#L37), [mcp_server.py](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/mcp_server.py#L70), [cli.py](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/cli.py#L168), [mempal_save_hook.sh](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/hooks/mempal_save_hook.sh#L129), [mempal_precompact_hook.sh](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/hooks/mempal_precompact_hook.sh#L71)
- **What it does**: Source-confirmed. MemPalace logs diagnostics to `stderr`, keeps a JSONL write-ahead log, stores hook activity in `~/.mempalace/hook_state/hook.log`, and exposes repair/rebuild commands. But its hook design always or periodically blocks and then relies on the AI to classify and save correctly.
- **Why it matters**: Public should copy the observability and repair posture, not the forced-save control flow. Local audit trails and recovery tools build trust; blocking the runtime and delegating correctness back to the model creates noisy UX and only a weak guarantee that the right information was preserved.
- **Recommendation**: reject
- **Impact**: high

### Finding 7: AAAK-heavy compression is an experimental side lane, not an architectural foundation
- **Source**: [README.md](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/README.md#L52), [README.md](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/README.md#L200), [mcp_server.py](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/mcp_server.py#L178), [mcp_server.py](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/mcp_server.py#L511)
- **What it does**: Mixed evidence. The README correction explicitly says AAAK is lossy and regresses raw retrieval, while the MCP server still teaches the dialect on startup and stores diary entries in raw AAAK even though the code notes that compressed AAAK hurts embedding quality.
- **Why it matters**: Public should not import the compression dialect, closet marketing, or diary-in-AAAK model. MemPalace’s real value is its raw substrate and protocol discipline; AAAK is currently a truthfulness and maintenance risk, not a design center.
- **Recommendation**: reject
- **Impact**: high

## Assessment
- New information ratio: 0.36

## Recommended Next Focus
Convert this ADR into a final adoption matrix for iteration 30: `adopt now` should be protocol bootstrap, bounded verbatim evidence retention, and local audit/repair surfaces; `prototype later` should be a temporal fact sidecar and optional wake-up brief; `reject` should remain forced hook-blocking saves and AAAK-centered compression as core architecture.

# Iteration 029: ARCHITECTURE DECISION RECORD

## Focus
ARCHITECTURE DECISION RECORD: Document the key architectural decisions this system made and why. Which decisions should we adopt and which should we reject?

## Findings
### Finding 1: Keep verbatim evidence as the authority, then add narrower retrieval views on top
- **Source**: [miner.py](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/miner.py#L3), [searcher.py](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/searcher.py#L21), [BENCHMARKS.md](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/benchmarks/BENCHMARKS.md#L16), [generate-context.js](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/dist/memory/generate-context.js#L85)
- **What it does**: Source-confirmed. MemPalace mines files into verbatim drawer chunks with no summary-first reduction, then searches those drawers directly. Its strongest benchmark claims are explicitly tied to raw mode, not AAAK. Public already makes the same truthfulness move on save input: structured JSON is authoritative and should not be reconstructed later.
- **Why it matters**: This is the right architectural center of gravity. Public should not become raw-everything-by-default, but it should preserve more verbatim evidence for high-value decisions, quotes, and failure context instead of forcing every useful memory into a compressed abstraction.
- **Recommendation**: adopt now
- **Impact**: high

### Finding 2: Taxonomy is useful as a metadata routing overlay, not as a distinct retrieval engine
- **Source**: [README.md](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/README.md#L62), [README.md](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/README.md#L192), [searcher.py](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/searcher.py#L34), [palace_graph.py](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/palace_graph.py#L33)
- **What it does**: Mixed evidence. The README correction explicitly says the “palace boost” was really wing/room metadata filtering, and the code matches that: search is standard Chroma where-filters, while the palace graph is derived from existing metadata rather than a separate retrieval stack.
- **Why it matters**: Public should adopt the honest version of this decision. Taxonomy can help narrow search scope, explain navigation, and surface cross-domain bridges, but it should stay a post-routing precision aid rather than a new “third lane” beside semantic and lexical retrieval.
- **Recommendation**: adopt now
- **Impact**: medium

### Finding 3: Status should teach the agent how to use memory, not just report health
- **Source**: [mcp_server.py](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/mcp_server.py#L139), [mcp_server.py](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/mcp_server.py#L169), [context-server.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/context-server.ts#L741)
- **What it does**: Source-confirmed. `mempalace_status` returns counts plus `PALACE_PROTOCOL` and `AAAK_SPEC`, so the first health call also trains behavior: verify before speaking, write a diary after sessions, invalidate stale facts. Public already computes startup instructions and recovery guidance, but it is broader and less memory-protocol-specific.
- **Why it matters**: This is one of MemPalace’s best decisions. Public should add a compact, explicit memory-usage contract to bootstrap/status surfaces so agents are reminded when to search, when to trust structure, and when to save.
- **Recommendation**: adopt now
- **Impact**: high

### Finding 4: A cheap wake-up stack is reusable, but not as a replacement for Public’s stronger resume/bootstrap flow
- **Source**: [layers.py](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/layers.py#L3), [layers.py](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/layers.py#L76), [layers.py](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/layers.py#L389), [context-server.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/context-server.ts#L764)
- **What it does**: Source-confirmed. MemPalace splits startup into L0 identity text, L1 top-drawer summary, L2 filtered recall, and L3 deep search. The implementation is simpler than the README framing suggests: L1 is just top-weight drawer snippets grouped by room, not a sophisticated session-recovery model.
- **Why it matters**: Public already has the more robust recovery spine with `session_bootstrap`, `session_resume`, and structural freshness checks. The reusable part is the idea of a tiny, cheap “wake-up brief” for hot starts, not the whole MemPalace layering model as a new source of truth.
- **Recommendation**: prototype later
- **Impact**: medium

### Finding 5: Keep mutable facts in a separate temporal store with explicit invalidation
- **Source**: [knowledge_graph.py](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/knowledge_graph.py#L1), [knowledge_graph.py](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/knowledge_graph.py#L56), [knowledge_graph.py](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/knowledge_graph.py#L121), [knowledge_graph.py](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/knowledge_graph.py#L180)
- **What it does**: Source-confirmed. MemPalace keeps facts in a separate SQLite WAL-backed graph with `valid_from`/`valid_to`, `source_closet`, and explicit invalidation, instead of trying to force mutable facts into the same substrate as verbatim drawers.
- **Why it matters**: This separation is architecturally sound. Public already has causal links and graph-aware retrieval, but not a true temporal fact store. A narrow temporal sidecar for changed facts, identities, and state transitions would reduce ambiguity without contaminating the main memory corpus.
- **Recommendation**: prototype later
- **Impact**: high

### Finding 6: Strong forensic surfaces are worth copying; forced hook-blocking saves are not
- **Source**: [mcp_server.py](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/mcp_server.py#L37), [mcp_server.py](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/mcp_server.py#L70), [cli.py](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/cli.py#L168), [mempal_save_hook.sh](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/hooks/mempal_save_hook.sh#L129), [mempal_precompact_hook.sh](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/hooks/mempal_precompact_hook.sh#L71)
- **What it does**: Source-confirmed. MemPalace logs diagnostics to `stderr`, keeps a JSONL write-ahead log, stores hook activity in `~/.mempalace/hook_state/hook.log`, and exposes repair/rebuild commands. But its hook design always or periodically blocks and then relies on the AI to classify and save correctly.
