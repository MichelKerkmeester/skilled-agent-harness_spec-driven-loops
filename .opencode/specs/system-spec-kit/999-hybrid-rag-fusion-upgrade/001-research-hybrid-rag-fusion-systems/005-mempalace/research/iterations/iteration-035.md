### Finding 8: Reject AAAK-first recall and full palace taxonomy as core Public architecture
- **Source**: [README.md](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/README.md#L58), [README.md](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/README.md#L292), [mcp_server.py](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/mcp_server.py#L510), [room_detector_local.py](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/room_detector_local.py#L97), [BENCHMARKS.md](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/benchmarks/BENCHMARKS.md#L604)
- **What it does**: AAAK is explicitly lossy and benchmark-worse than raw mode; room routing underperforms the stronger no-rooms hybrid baseline.
- **Why it matters**: Both ideas add governance and truthfulness risk without enough upside for Public’s current architecture.
- **Recommendation**: reject
- **Priority**: 8
- **Effort**: 1/5
- **Impact**: 3/5

## Assessment
- New information ratio: 0.10
- Repo note: `external/AGENTS.md` exists, `research/research.md` is an appended multi-pass file whose cleanest current verdict is the final synthesis block near the end, and there is no persisted `iteration-030.md`.
- Operational note: strict validation returned `PASSED`, but also emitted a temp-file warning under the read-only sandbox; I could not update the phase files, create `implementation-summary.md`, or run the phase memory save.

## Recommended Next Focus
Implement the three `adopt now` items first in this order: compaction-time JSON-primary checkpoint, bootstrap memory-protocol hints, and audit/repair surfaces. After that, prototype selective verbatim evidence retention, a wake-up retrieval profile, and a citation-governed temporal fact sidecar; keep forced blocking saves, AAAK-first recall, and full palace taxonomy out of the near-term roadmap.

## Findings
For EACH finding:
### Finding N: [Title]

## Assessment
- **New information ratio**: 0.12
- **Questions addressed**: phased sequencing, dependency ordering, what to keep out of the roadmap
- **Questions answered**: Q1 should be deterministic preservation plus protocol plus observability; Q2 should stay scoped to evidence retention and wake-up retrieval; Q3 should isolate temporal facts as a sidecar
- **Novelty justification**: This pass adds delivery sequencing and dependency structure on top of the settled 30-iteration recommendation set rather than introducing new primitives.
- **Operational note**: strict validation passed for the phase folder, but the validator reported a temp-file warning under the read-only sandbox, and I could not write this draft back to `research/research.md` or create the missing spec artifacts.

## Ruled Out
- Forced hook-blocking saves as the primary preservation mechanism because they interrupt the runtime without guaranteeing high-quality capture.
- AAAK-first recall because the repo’s own April 7, 2026 correction and benchmark notes mark it as lossy and worse than raw mode.
- Full palace taxonomy as core Public architecture because the practical value is in disciplined filters and hints, not the metaphor itself.

## Reflection
- **What worked**: Using the final synthesis block in [research.md#L290535](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/research/research.md#L290535) as the base and then re-checking the underlying source lines made the roadmap stable and low-drift.
- **What did not work**: The phase folder is not actually in the Level 3-on-disk state described by the prompt, so I could not turn this into a persisted packet update in this session.
- **What I would do differently**: Next pass should write this draft into `research/research.md`, update the checklist and implementation summary, and convert the roadmap into concrete follow-on implementation phases.

## Recommended Next Focus
Translate this roadmap into implementation packets: one Q1 packet for checkpointing and bootstrap hints, one Q1 packet for audit/repair surfaces, one Q2 packet for bounded verbatim evidence plus wake-up profile, and one Q3 packet for the temporal fact sidecar.

## Findings
For EACH finding:
### Finding N: [Title]
- **Novelty justification**: prior iterations identified what to adopt; this pass adds migration-specific breakage modes, rollout flags, and rollback mechanics grounded in current Public code.
- **Operational note**: the exact validator command returned `RESULT: PASSED`, but the packet currently infers as Level 1 and the checkout only contains [research/research.md](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/research/research.md#L1), not the expected Level 3 doc set. I could not persist iteration 32 because the sandbox is read-only.

## Ruled Out
- MemPalace-style hard blocking as the primary checkpoint mechanism, because it couples preservation to agent compliance.
- A second standalone bootstrap authority, because Public already has `session_bootstrap`, `session_resume`, and startup instructions.
- Raw repair or import flows that bypass `memory_health`, because Public’s current repair contract is bounded and confirmation-gated.

## Reflection
- **What worked**: anchoring on the final synthesis block first, then validating each adopt-now item against current source lines, kept the migration matrix consistent with the packet’s existing direction.
- **What did not work**: the phase folder is not in the expected on-disk Level 3 state, and the read-only sandbox prevented updating `research/research.md`, `implementation-summary.md`, or memory artifacts.
- **What I would do differently**: next pass should be a write-enabled rollout packet that converts these three findings into implementation phases with explicit flags, metrics, and disable paths.

## Recommended Next Focus
Create one implementation packet per adopt-now item, with rollout order:
1. compaction checkpoint in advisory mode first,
2. bootstrap hint extension second,
3. audit/repair surfaces third.

Each packet should ship with a kill switch, a success metric, and a one-command rollback path before any wider enablement.

For EACH finding:
### Finding N: [Title]

## Assessment
- New information ratio: 0.23
- Questions addressed: unit-test shape, integration-test shape, compaction-survival verification, memory-quality regression design, hygiene/temporal invariants, CI lane split
- Questions answered: fast unit coverage should stay fixture-backed and local; integration should prove save/restore/compaction continuity; regression testing should use seeded facts plus thresholds and existing eval channels, not only API-shape assertions
- Novelty justification: prior iterations identified what to adopt, but this pass adds the concrete verification architecture, dataset strategy, and CI split needed to ship those ideas safely

## Ruled Out
- One monolithic end-to-end suite that tries to prove correctness, scale, compaction survival, and quality in a single run
- Pure LLM-judged memory-quality tests without planted answers or numeric baselines
- Putting scale or ablation benchmarks into every default CI run
- Treating repair and invalidation features as “best effort” behavior without invariant tests

## Reflection
- What worked: reading the external test suite before the benchmark docs made the testing strategy concrete instead of speculative, and cross-checking against existing Public Vitest coverage showed we already have most of the harness primitives
- What did not work: the sandbox is read-only, so I could not append iteration 33 into [research.md](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/research/research.md) or update packet artifacts
- What I would do differently: next write-enabled pass should convert this directly into a test matrix section with named suites, thresholds, fixture locations, and CI/nightly ownership

## Recommended Next Focus
Define the exact thresholds and datasets for the adopted-pattern rollout: recall@5 and recall@10 floors, acceptable ablation deltas, wake-up token cap, compaction-survival assertions, and which checks run on PRs versus nightly.

## Findings
For EACH finding:
### Finding N: [Title]
- **Questions addressed**: search latency, storage growth, indexing overhead, startup time impact
- **Questions answered**: MemPalace’s direct semantic search is cheap; its wake-up/status/graph helpers become collection-scan heavy; hook-based preservation introduces visible latency and duplicate-cleanup debt; raw storage shifts cost from extraction to storage and maintenance; Public’s heavier startup is a deliberate trade for safer steady-state behavior
- **Novelty justification**: This pass adds an explicit cost model for the already-ranked architecture decisions by showing exactly where MemPalace pushes work into blocking hooks and full-collection scans, and where Public already absorbs comparable cost in safer startup/index phases.

## Ruled Out
- Full raw-verbatim-by-default adoption for Public, because the storage-growth and repair/dedup burden is too high for the marginal retrieval win over our current selective save path.
- Hook-blocking as the primary preservation mechanism, because it protects against compaction loss by injecting latency and duplicate risk into active sessions.
- AAAK or room-routing as the main performance lever, because the repo’s own corrected evidence shows token savings do not currently outweigh retrieval regressions and sidecar overhead.

## Reflection
- **What worked**: Reading the performance-critical source paths in order from search/wake-up to hooks/repair/startup made the trade-offs concrete instead of speculative.
- **What did not work**: The CocoIndex MCP search kept cancelling in this session, so I had to rely on direct file reads; the phase folder also still infers as Level 1, and strict validation passed with a temp-file warning under the read-only sandbox.
- **What I would do differently**: In a write-enabled pass, I would append this iteration into `research/research.md` and add one small benchmark matrix for Public: startup budget, p95 `memory_search`, storage growth per save, and compaction checkpoint cost.

## Recommended Next Focus
Turn these trade-offs into rollout budgets for Public:
1. Set explicit p95 latency targets for `session_bootstrap`, `memory_search`, and trigger matching.
2. Define storage-growth thresholds comparing JSON-primary saves versus any verbatim sidecar prototype.
3. Benchmark startup cost with and without BM25 rebuild, background scan, and cognitive modules.
4. If a temporal fact sidecar is explored, measure lookup latency and write amplification separately from the main memory index.

RESEARCH BRIEF:
# $refine TIDD-EC Prompt: 005-mempalace

## 2. Role

You are a research specialist in verbatim AI memory systems, ChromaDB-based semantic retrieval, navigable memory taxonomies, wake-up context layering, MCP tool design, hook-driven persistence, and local temporal knowledge graphs. Work like a systems analyst who can separate README positioning from verified Python mechanics, trace how MemPalace composes mining, storage, retrieval, hooks, and protocol guidance, and translate those choices into practical improvements for `Code_Environment/Public`.

## 3. Task

Research MemPalace's raw-verbatim memory architecture, palace taxonomy, wake-up stack, MCP protocol/tooling, hook-driven save flow, and temporal knowledge-graph patterns to identify practical, evidence-backed improvements for `Code_Environment/Public`, especially around session continuity, compaction survival, memory hygiene, and agent-facing recall ergonomics. Determine which MemPalace ideas should be `adopt now`, `prototype later`, or `reject`. Keep the analysis honest about what is source-confirmed, what is README-documented, and what is benchmark-claim territory.

## 4. Context

### 4.1 System Description

MemPalace is a local Python memory system centered on a strong design claim: keep raw conversation and project text instead of extracting only summarized facts, then make that verbatim corpus searchable and navigable. The external repo exposes a CLI, an MCP server, hook scripts, a ChromaDB-backed drawer store, a wake-up layering system, and a separate SQLite temporal knowledge graph. Its storage model uses palace terminology: wings for people/projects/topics, halls for shared memory categories, rooms for named ideas, closets for compact summaries, and drawers for original verbatim content.

The most important architectural tension in this phase is that MemPalace mixes strong implementation ideas with aggressive README claims that the project itself partially corrects in its April 7, 2026 note. The raw-verbatim result is the standout claim; AAAK is explicitly experimental and lossy; contradiction detection is documented as incomplete; and some benchmark or rerank claims live more in docs than in source. This phase should reward the underlying architecture where the code supports it, but it must not let benchmark marketing or future-looking README language blur the evidence line.

The repo appears to support three ingestion shapes into one shared memory backend: project mining, conversation mining, and a general heuristic extraction mode. Retrieval then spans direct semantic search, wake-up text generation across L0-L3 layers, palace graph traversal via shared room metadata, and MCP tooling that teaches an operational memory protocol to the agent through the status response itself. Hook scripts add another layer: instead of a memory system that only responds to explicit search/save calls, MemPalace also tries to shape the timing of memory writes at stop and pre-compact boundaries.

### 4.2 Cross-Phase Awareness Table

| Phase | System | Core Pattern | Overlap Risk | Differentiation |
|-------|--------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|
| 001 | Engram | MCP memory server (Go, SQLite+FTS5) | 005 (memory server), 004 (session continuity) | Focus tool profiles, session lifecycle, topic keys |
| 002 | Mex | Markdown scaffold + drift detection | 005 (project knowledge) | Focus drift detection, scaffold structure, no-DB approach |
| 003 | Modus Memory | FSRS spaced repetition + BM25 | 005 (local memory) | Focus FSRS decay, BM25, librarian expansion, cross-references |
| 004 | OpenCode Mnemosyne | Hybrid search (FTS5 + vector) | 005 (compaction, hybrid retrieval claims) | Focus plugin architecture, project/global scoping, wrapper boundary |
| 005 | MemPalace | Raw verbatim storage + palace taxonomy + hooks + temporal KG | 001 (MCP memory), 004 (compaction/helping memory survive), 003 (local memory) | Focus raw-no-extraction posture, wake-up layers, hooks, palace structure, temporal KG |

### 4.3 What This Repo Already Has

`Code_Environment/Public` already has Spec Kit Memory with hybrid retrieval, `memory_search`, `memory_context`, `memory_match_triggers`, memory-save flows through `generate-context.js`, session/bootstrap handling in the memory MCP server, and compaction-oriented structural transport via `.opencode/plugins/spec-kit-compact-code-graph.js`. It also already has semantic code search via CocoIndex and structured graph context via Compact Code Graph.

What it does **not** currently have is a raw-verbatim-by-default memory posture comparable to MemPalace's drawer model, a first-class wing/hall/room taxonomy for agent memory navigation, a dedicated L0/L1/L2/L3 wake-up stack for context loading, MemPalace-style stop/pre-compact save hooks that actively block to force preservation, or a separate temporal entity-triple knowledge graph with explicit invalidation alongside the main memory store. The comparison should stay anchored to those gaps rather than repeating generic hybrid-RAG analysis already covered elsewhere.

## 5. Instructions

1. Treat `/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace` as the pre-approved phase folder. Skip Gate 3, keep all writes inside this phase folder, and treat everything under `external/` as read-only.
2. Read the governing Public repo `AGENTS.md` first. Then explicitly verify whether `external/AGENTS.md` exists. If it does not, note that absence as evidence about repo scope rather than inventing external workflow constraints.
3. Before deep research begins, ensure this phase folder contains Level 3 Spec Kit docs: `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`, `checklist.md`, and `decision-record.md`.
4. Use `@speckit` for markdown authoring when the runtime supports agent routing. If routing is unavailable, preserve existing Spec Kit Level 3 structure manually without creating side-channel docs outside the phase folder.
5. Start with `external/README.md`, but read it critically. Cover these sections in order: the April 7, 2026 correction note; Quick Start; How You Actually Use It; The Palace; wake-up / AAAK sections; MCP tools; benchmark sections. Capture both the architecture claims and the repo's own admitted overstatements.
6. Immediately after the README, read `external/pyproject.toml` and `external/mempalace/cli.py`. Confirm the actual runtime boundary, command surface, install assumptions, and the core flows for `init`, `mine`, `search`, `wake-up`, `status`, `repair`, and `compress`.
7. Trace the MCP surface end to end in `external/mempalace/mcp_server.py`. Focus on tool registration, read/write split, stderr logging behavior, `PALACE_PROTOCOL`, `AAAK_SPEC`, status bootstrap behavior, duplicate checking, graph tools, knowledge-graph tools, diary tools, and what the tool names imply about agent discipline.
8. Trace retrieval and context loading next in `external/mempalace/searcher.py` and `external/mempalace/layers.py`. Capture the raw ChromaDB query path, wing/room filtering, L0/L1/L2/L3 layering, wake-up token assumptions, and how much of that layering is implementation versus README framing.
9. Trace structural navigation next in `external/mempalace/palace_graph.py` and `external/mempalace/knowledge_graph.py`. Keep these separate in your notes: palace graph traversal is metadata-derived from ChromaDB rooms/halls/wings, while the knowledge graph is a separate SQLite temporal triple store with invalidation.
10. Trace ingestion behavior next. Read `external/mempalace/miner.py`, `external/mempalace/convo_miner.py`, `external/mempalace/general_extractor.py`, and `external/mempalace/onboarding.py`. Focus on chunking strategy, room detection, no-summary posture, heuristic extraction, onboarding assumptions, and whether the system truly keeps everything or selectively restructures it during ingest.
11. Read hook and benchmark artifacts after the implementation core: `external/hooks/README.md`, `external/hooks/mempal_save_hook.sh`, `external/hooks/mempal_precompact_hook.sh`, and `external/benchmarks/BENCHMARKS.md`. Treat these as crucial to the product story, but distinguish carefully between executable behavior, experimental behavior, and benchmark claims that require caution.
12. Compare MemPalace directly against current `Code_Environment/Public` code: `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/handlers/memory-search.ts`, `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/context-server.ts`, `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/dist/memory/generate-context.js`, and `.opencode/plugins/spec-kit-compact-code-graph.js`. Be explicit about what Public already covers better and what MemPalace still contributes.
13. Before the main research pass, validate the phase folder with this exact command:
    ```bash
    cd /Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public && bash .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/spec/validate.sh "/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace" --strict
    ```
14. After validation passes, run `spec_kit:deep-research` with this exact topic:
    ```text
    Research the external repository at /Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external and identify concrete improvements for Code_Environment/Public, especially around raw verbatim memory storage, palace taxonomy (wings/halls/rooms), wake-up context layering, MCP protocol/tool design, hook-driven save flows, and temporal knowledge-graph patterns.
    ```
15. Save all outputs inside `research/`, with `research/research.md` as the canonical report. Every meaningful finding must cite exact file paths, say whether the evidence is `source-confirmed`, `README-documented`, `benchmark-documented`, or mixed, explain why it matters for `Code_Environment/Public`, classify the recommendation as `adopt now`, `prototype later`, or `reject`, identify the affected subsystem, and note migration or truthfulness risk. When research is complete, update `checklist.md`, create `implementation-summary.md`, and save memory with:
    ```bash
    cd /Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public && node .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/dist/memory/generate-context.js "/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace"
    ```

## 6. Research Questions

1. What does MemPalace gain from its raw-verbatim "store everything, then make it findable" posture, and where would that improve or conflict with Spec Kit Memory's more selective save and retrieval model?
2. How useful is the wing / hall / room / closet / drawer taxonomy in practice: does it materially improve navigation and recall, or does it mostly reframe metadata filtering in memorable language?
3. How does the L0/L1/L2/L3 wake-up stack compare with Public's `session_bootstrap`, `memory_context`, and compaction-recovery flows, and what parts of the layering model are reusable here?
4. What does `mcp_server.py` gain by embedding `PALACE_PROTOCOL` and `AAAK_SPEC` directly in the status bootstrap, and could Public benefit from similarly direct memory-usage guidance without adding prompt clutter?
5. How effective are the stop-hook and pre-compact-hook patterns at protecting context before loss, and how do they compare to Public's existing compaction-oriented structural plugin and memory-save workflows?
6. What are the real architectural consequences of keeping the temporal knowledge graph separate from the drawer store, especially around invalidation, diary entries, and fact-vs-verbatim boundaries?
7. How much of MemPalace's benchmark story is supported directly by code in this repo, and which claims should remain benchmark candidates or doc-level references rather than implementation truths?
8. How do `miner.py`, `convo_miner.py`, and `general_extractor.py` balance "store everything" against chunking, heuristics, room assignment, and extraction side paths?
9. Which MemPalace ideas most improve compaction survival and startup continuity for future Public sessions: wake-up layers, hook timing, memory protocol bootstrapping, diary writing, or taxonomy-based narrowing?
10. Which MemPalace features are genuinely reusable architecture, and which are presentation choices, experimental layers, or hype-prone claims that Public should not copy?
11. How should AAAK be evaluated honestly: as a useful optional compression dialect, a still-unproven context-loading experiment, or mostly a distraction from the stronger raw-verbatim baseline?

## 7. Do's

- Do distinguish raw verbatim storage from AAAK compression; they are not the same feature and do not have the same evidence quality.
- Do separate palace graph traversal from the temporal knowledge graph; one is metadata-derived navigation and the other is explicit fact storage with validity windows.
- Do inspect the actual hook scripts, not just their README, so the analysis captures the precise blocking behavior before save and compaction.
- Do compare MemPalace's wake-up flow against current Public bootstrap and compaction behavior using real Public files.
- Do treat the April 7, 2026 correction note as important evidence about truthfulness boundaries and product honesty.
- Do analyze how status/bootstrap responses teach the agent what to do, not just what data they return.
- Do map strong findings to specific Public subsystems such as Spec Kit Memory retrieval, context bootstrap, save flows, or compaction handling.

## 8. Don'ts

- Do not describe MemPalace as "just ChromaDB search"; the repo's differentiators are raw-storage posture, wake-up layers, hooks, taxonomy, and KG split.
- Do not treat README benchmark numbers as fully source-proven implementation facts unless the repo actually exposes the relevant pipeline.
- Do not recommend copying AAAK or benchmark marketing language wholesale into Public planning.
- Do not collapse this phase into generic hybrid-RAG analysis already owned by earlier phases.
- Do not ignore the repo's admitted inaccuracies or unresolved claims; they are central to evaluating whether an idea is production-worthy.
- Do not overlook the difference between "AI remembers because storage exists" and "AI remembers because the protocol tells it when and how to use storage."
- Do not edit anything under `external/` or outside this phase folder.

## 9. Examples

### Example A: Wake-up and protocol finding

```text
**Finding: Status doubles as a behavior bootstrap, not just a health check**
- Source: external/mempalace/mcp_server.py; external/mempalace/layers.py
- Evidence type: source-confirmed
- What it does: `mempalace_status` returns palace overview data plus `PALACE_PROTOCOL` and `AAAK_SPEC`, while the wake-up stack separately loads L0/L1 context for cheap startup continuity.
- Why it matters: Public already has resume/bootstrap tooling, but it does not currently use one memory-facing status surface to teach concrete retrieval and save behavior this directly.
- Recommendation: prototype later
- Affected area: memory bootstrap UX, session recovery guidance, compaction recovery behavior
- Risk/cost: Medium; could add prompt noise or duplicate existing guidance if not scoped carefully
```

### Example B: Hook-driven preservation finding

```text
**Finding: Save timing is enforced by hooks, not left to agent initiative alone**
- Source: external/hooks/mempal_save_hook.sh; external/hooks/mempal_precompact_hook.sh; external/hooks/README.md
- Evidence type: source-confirmed + README-documented
- What it does: the stop hook blocks every N human exchanges and the pre-compact hook always blocks, forcing the agent to preserve key context before loss.
- Why it matters: Public has compaction-oriented structural transport, but it does not currently enforce a comparable memory-preservation checkpoint before context collapse.
- Recommendation: adopt now or prototype later, depending on runtime surface
- Affected area: memory save automation, compaction resilience, agent operating protocol
- Risk/cost: Medium; intrusive save prompts and duplicate writes need guardrails
```

## 10. Constraints

### 10.1 Error handling

- If a README or benchmark claim is not directly supported by source, label it clearly as documentation- or benchmark-level evidence rather than implementation fact.
- If MemPalace's docs contradict its code or its own April 2026 correction note, prefer source evidence and call out the contradiction explicitly.
- If comparison assumptions about current `Code_Environment/Public` behavior are outdated, correct them in the research instead of preserving stale framing.
- If the external repo structure differs from the paths named here, preserve the same analytical order and document the actual files used.

### 10.2 Scope

**IN SCOPE**

- raw verbatim storage and no-summary posture
- palace taxonomy: wings, halls, rooms, closets, drawers
- L0/L1/L2/L3 wake-up layering
- MCP server design, status bootstrap, protocol guidance, diary tools
- stop and pre-compact hook behavior
- temporal knowledge graph and invalidation model
- mining modes, chunking, heuristics, onboarding
- benchmark and README truthfulness boundaries
- comparison against current Public memory, bootstrap, save, and compaction flows

**OUT OF SCOPE**

- generic Python style commentary
- speculative cloud scaling or hosted-service redesigns
- broad vector-database taxonomy disconnected from MemPalace evidence
- re-litigating BM25/FSRS/plugin topics already owned by earlier phases
- editing or fixing MemPalace itself

### 10.3 Prioritization framework

Rank findings in this order: leverage for Public session continuity, compaction-survival value, truthfulness and evidence quality, fit with current Spec Kit Memory capabilities, operational simplicity, memory-hygiene impact, and clean differentiation from phases `001` through `004`.

## 11. Deliverables

- `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`, `checklist.md`, and `decision-record.md` present and valid before deep research starts
- `research/research.md` as the canonical report with at least 5 evidence-backed findings
- explicit comparison against current Public memory retrieval, bootstrap, save, and compaction behavior
- each finding labeled `adopt now`, `prototype later`, or `reject`
- each finding states evidence type: `source-confirmed`, `README-documented`, `benchmark-documented`, or mixed
- `implementation-summary.md` created at the end
- memory saved from this phase folder using `generate-context.js`

Minimum finding schema:

- finding title
- exact source evidence
- evidence type
- what MemPalace does
- why it matters for `Code_Environment/Public`
- recommendation: `adopt now`, `prototype later`, or `reject`
- affected subsystem
- migration, ambiguity, or truthfulness risk

## 12. Evaluation Criteria

- CLEAR target: `>= 40/50`
- RICCE compliance is visible in the prompt:
  - **Role** is specialized in verbatim memory systems, wake-up layering, MCP protocol design, hooks, and temporal KG behavior
  - **Instructions** are ordered, concrete, path-specific, and honest about evidence boundaries
  - **Context** is domain-specific, cross-phase aware, and corrected for current Public capabilities
  - **Constraints** clearly separate source-confirmed behavior from README or benchmark claims
  - **Examples** show strong MemPalace-derived findings about protocol bootstrapping and hook-driven preservation
- at least 5 findings are evidence-backed rather than speculative
- findings explicitly separate raw-mode strengths from AAAK's experimental status
- findings compare MemPalace against today's Public bootstrap and compaction behavior rather than a stale baseline
- cross-phase overlap with `001` through `004` is explicitly bounded so this phase stays focused on raw-verbatim architecture, wake-up layers, hooks, and KG split

## 13. Completion Bar

The phase is only complete when all of the following are true:

- the reading order covered README honesty notes, CLI/runtime boundaries, MCP server, retrieval layers, palace graph, temporal KG, ingest pipeline, hooks, and benchmarks
- current `Code_Environment/Public` memory/bootstrap/compaction behavior was compared using code, not assumptions
- the validation command passed on this exact phase folder
- the exact deep-research topic string appears in the work
- `research/research.md` contains at least 5 evidence-backed findings
- each finding distinguishes source-confirmed behavior from README or benchmark claims where needed
- `checklist.md` is updated with evidence and completion marks
- `implementation-summary.md` exists
- memory is saved successfully for `005-mempalace`
- no edits were made outside this phase folder
- recommendations explicitly address raw storage, taxonomy, wake-up layering, hooks, and temporal KG patterns

I’m treating this as a read-only deep-research pass for iteration 35, focused on compatibility and conflict analysis between MemPalace and our existing memory, CocoIndex, code-graph, and MCP stack. I’ll refresh the most relevant prior context, inspect the external and Public source paths named in the brief, and then synthesize this iteration in the requested format with exact file evidence.

# Autonomous Deep Research Loop

Iterative research protocol with fresh context per iteration, externalized state, and convergence detection for deep technical investigation.

Runtime path resolution:
- OpenCode/Copilot runtime: `.opencode/agent/*.md`
- Claude runtime: `.claude/agents/*.md`
- Codex runtime: `.codex/agents/*.toml`

<!-- ANCHOR:when-to-use -->
## 1. WHEN TO USE

### When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Deep investigation requiring multiple rounds of discovery
- Topic spans 3+ technical domains or sources
- Initial findings need progressive refinement
- Overnight or unattended research sessions
- Research where prior findings inform subsequent queries

### When NOT to Use

- Simple, single-question research (use direct codebase search or `/spec_kit:plan`)
- Known-solution documentation (use `/spec_kit:plan`)
- Implementation tasks (use `/spec_kit:implement`)
- Quick codebase searches (use `@context` or direct Grep/Glob)
- Fewer than 3 sources needed (single-pass research suffices)

### Keyword Triggers

`autoresearch`, `deep research`, `autonomous research`, `research loop`, `iterative research`, `multi-round research`, `deep investigation`, `comprehensive research`

For iterative code review and quality auditing, see `sk-deep-review`.

### Lifecycle Contract

Live lifecycle branches:
- `resume` — continue the active lineage
- `restart` — start a new generation with explicit parent linkage
- `fork` — branch from the current packet state
- `completed-continue` — reopen a completed lineage only after immutable synthesis snapshotting

    if not hasattr(_guard_in_skill, '_active'):
        _guard_in_skill._active = True

    """Discover all .md files in the assets directory."""
    return sorted(str(p.relative_to(base_path)) for p in (base_path / "references").glob("*.md"))
```

### Phase Detection

Detect the current research phase from dispatch context to load appropriate resources:

| Phase | Signal | Resources to Load |
|-------|--------|-------------------|
| Init | No JSONL exists | Loop protocol, state format |
| Iteration | Dispatch context includes iteration number | Loop protocol, convergence |
| Stuck | Dispatch context includes "RECOVERY" | Convergence, loop protocol |
| Synthesis | Convergence triggered STOP | Quick reference |

### Core Innovation: Fresh Context Per Iteration

Each agent dispatch gets a fresh context window. State continuity comes from files, not memory. This solves context degradation in long research sessions.

Adapted from: karpathy/autoresearch (loop concept), AGR (fresh context "Ralph Loop"), pi-autoresearch (JSONL state), autoresearch-opencode (context injection).

### Data Flow

```
Init --> Create config.json, strategy.md, state.jsonl
  |
Loop --> Read state --> Check convergence --> Dispatch @deep-research
  |                                              |
  |                                              v
  |                                         Agent executes:
  |                                         1. Read state files
  |                                         2. Determine focus
  |                                         3. Research (3-5 actions)
  |                                         4. Write iteration-NNN.md
  |                                         5. Update strategy.md
  |                                         6. Append state.jsonl
  |                                              |
  +<--- Evaluate results <-----------------------+
  |
  +--- Continue? --> Yes: next iteration
  |                  No: exit loop
  v
Synthesize --> Compile final research/research.md
  |
Save --> generate-context.js --> verify memory artifact
```

### Key Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Externalized state** | All research continuity via files, not agent memory |
| **Fresh context** | Each iteration gets a clean agent with no prior context |
| **Convergence** | Multi-signal detection: newInfoRatio, stuck count, questions answered |
| **Strategy file** | Reducer-synchronized research steering with machine-owned sections |
| **JSONL log** | Append-only structured log for lineage and iteration data |
| **Findings registry** | Reducer-owned open/resolved questions, key findings, and ruled-out directions |

codex
I’ve confirmed the external repo does have its own `AGENTS.md`, so I’m pulling that in before I inspect the MemPalace source itself. Next I’m reading the external instructions alongside the phase-local research prompt and the current iteration history so this pass stays compatible with the existing synthesis instead of drifting.

# $refine TIDD-EC Prompt: 005-mempalace

## 2. Role

You are a research specialist in verbatim AI memory systems, ChromaDB-based semantic retrieval, navigable memory taxonomies, wake-up context layering, MCP tool design, hook-driven persistence, and local temporal knowledge graphs. Work like a systems analyst who can separate README positioning from verified Python mechanics, trace how MemPalace composes mining, storage, retrieval, hooks, and protocol guidance, and translate those choices into practical improvements for `Code_Environment/Public`.

## 3. Task

Research MemPalace's raw-verbatim memory architecture, palace taxonomy, wake-up stack, MCP protocol/tooling, hook-driven save flow, and temporal knowledge-graph patterns to identify practical, evidence-backed improvements for `Code_Environment/Public`, especially around session continuity, compaction survival, memory hygiene, and agent-facing recall ergonomics. Determine which MemPalace ideas should be `adopt now`, `prototype later`, or `reject`. Keep the analysis honest about what is source-confirmed, what is README-documented, and what is benchmark-claim territory.

## 4. Context

### 4.1 System Description

MemPalace is a local Python memory system centered on a strong design claim: keep raw conversation and project text instead of extracting only summarized facts, then make that verbatim corpus searchable and navigable. The external repo exposes a CLI, an MCP server, hook scripts, a ChromaDB-backed drawer store, a wake-up layering system, and a separate SQLite temporal knowledge graph. Its storage model uses palace terminology: wings for people/projects/topics, halls for shared memory categories, rooms for named ideas, closets for compact summaries, and drawers for original verbatim content.

The most important architectural tension in this phase is that MemPalace mixes strong implementation ideas with aggressive README claims that the project itself partially corrects in its April 7, 2026 note. The raw-verbatim result is the standout claim; AAAK is explicitly experimental and lossy; contradiction detection is documented as incomplete; and some benchmark or rerank claims live more in docs than in source. This phase should reward the underlying architecture where the code supports it, but it must not let benchmark marketing or future-looking README language blur the evidence line.

The repo appears to support three ingestion shapes into one shared memory backend: project mining, conversation mining, and a general heuristic extraction mode. Retrieval then spans direct semantic search, wake-up text generation across L0-L3 layers, palace graph traversal via shared room metadata, and MCP tooling that teaches an operational memory protocol to the agent through the status response itself. Hook scripts add another layer: instead of a memory system that only responds to explicit search/save calls, MemPalace also tries to shape the timing of memory writes at stop and pre-compact boundaries.

### 4.2 Cross-Phase Awareness Table

| Phase | System | Core Pattern | Overlap Risk | Differentiation |
|-------|--------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|
| 001 | Engram | MCP memory server (Go, SQLite+FTS5) | 005 (memory server), 004 (session continuity) | Focus tool profiles, session lifecycle, topic keys |
| 002 | Mex | Markdown scaffold + drift detection | 005 (project knowledge) | Focus drift detection, scaffold structure, no-DB approach |
| 003 | Modus Memory | FSRS spaced repetition + BM25 | 005 (local memory) | Focus FSRS decay, BM25, librarian expansion, cross-references |
| 004 | OpenCode Mnemosyne | Hybrid search (FTS5 + vector) | 005 (compaction, hybrid retrieval claims) | Focus plugin architecture, project/global scoping, wrapper boundary |
| 005 | MemPalace | Raw verbatim storage + palace taxonomy + hooks + temporal KG | 001 (MCP memory), 004 (compaction/helping memory survive), 003 (local memory) | Focus raw-no-extraction posture, wake-up layers, hooks, palace structure, temporal KG |

### 4.3 What This Repo Already Has

`Code_Environment/Public` already has Spec Kit Memory with hybrid retrieval, `memory_search`, `memory_context`, `memory_match_triggers`, memory-save flows through `generate-context.js`, session/bootstrap handling in the memory MCP server, and compaction-oriented structural transport via `.opencode/plugins/spec-kit-compact-code-graph.js`. It also already has semantic code search via CocoIndex and structured graph context via Compact Code Graph.

What it does **not** currently have is a raw-verbatim-by-default memory posture comparable to MemPalace's drawer model, a first-class wing/hall/room taxonomy for agent memory navigation, a dedicated L0/L1/L2/L3 wake-up stack for context loading, MemPalace-style stop/pre-compact save hooks that actively block to force preservation, or a separate temporal entity-triple knowledge graph with explicit invalidation alongside the main memory store. The comparison should stay anchored to those gaps rather than repeating generic hybrid-RAG analysis already covered elsewhere.

## 5. Instructions

1. Treat `/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace` as the pre-approved phase folder. Skip Gate 3, keep all writes inside this phase folder, and treat everything under `external/` as read-only.
2. Read the governing Public repo `AGENTS.md` first. Then explicitly verify whether `external/AGENTS.md` exists. If it does not, note that absence as evidence about repo scope rather than inventing external workflow constraints.
3. Before deep research begins, ensure this phase folder contains Level 3 Spec Kit docs: `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`, `checklist.md`, and `decision-record.md`.
4. Use `@speckit` for markdown authoring when the runtime supports agent routing. If routing is unavailable, preserve existing Spec Kit Level 3 structure manually without creating side-channel docs outside the phase folder.
5. Start with `external/README.md`, but read it critically. Cover these sections in order: the April 7, 2026 correction note; Quick Start; How You Actually Use It; The Palace; wake-up / AAAK sections; MCP tools; benchmark sections. Capture both the architecture claims and the repo's own admitted overstatements.
6. Immediately after the README, read `external/pyproject.toml` and `external/mempalace/cli.py`. Confirm the actual runtime boundary, command surface, install assumptions, and the core flows for `init`, `mine`, `search`, `wake-up`, `status`, `repair`, and `compress`.
7. Trace the MCP surface end to end in `external/mempalace/mcp_server.py`. Focus on tool registration, read/write split, stderr logging behavior, `PALACE_PROTOCOL`, `AAAK_SPEC`, status bootstrap behavior, duplicate checking, graph tools, knowledge-graph tools, diary tools, and what the tool names imply about agent discipline.
8. Trace retrieval and context loading next in `external/mempalace/searcher.py` and `external/mempalace/layers.py`. Capture the raw ChromaDB query path, wing/room filtering, L0/L1/L2/L3 layering, wake-up token assumptions, and how much of that layering is implementation versus README framing.
9. Trace structural navigation next in `external/mempalace/palace_graph.py` and `external/mempalace/knowledge_graph.py`. Keep these separate in your notes: palace graph traversal is metadata-derived from ChromaDB rooms/halls/wings, while the knowledge graph is a separate SQLite temporal triple store with invalidation.
10. Trace ingestion behavior next. Read `external/mempalace/miner.py`, `external/mempalace/convo_miner.py`, `external/mempalace/general_extractor.py`, and `external/mempalace/onboarding.py`. Focus on chunking strategy, room detection, no-summary posture, heuristic extraction, onboarding assumptions, and whether the system truly keeps everything or selectively restructures it during ingest.
11. Read hook and benchmark artifacts after the implementation core: `external/hooks/README.md`, `external/hooks/mempal_save_hook.sh`, `external/hooks/mempal_precompact_hook.sh`, and `external/benchmarks/BENCHMARKS.md`. Treat these as crucial to the product story, but distinguish carefully between executable behavior, experimental behavior, and benchmark claims that require caution.
12. Compare MemPalace directly against current `Code_Environment/Public` code: `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/handlers/memory-search.ts`, `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/context-server.ts`, `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/dist/memory/generate-context.js`, and `.opencode/plugins/spec-kit-compact-code-graph.js`. Be explicit about what Public already covers better and what MemPalace still contributes.
13. Before the main research pass, validate the phase folder with this exact command:
    ```bash
    cd /Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public && bash .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/spec/validate.sh "/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace" --strict
    ```
14. After validation passes, run `spec_kit:deep-research` with this exact topic:
    ```text
    Research the external repository at /Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external and identify concrete improvements for Code_Environment/Public, especially around raw verbatim memory storage, palace taxonomy (wings/halls/rooms), wake-up context layering, MCP protocol/tool design, hook-driven save flows, and temporal knowledge-graph patterns.
    ```
15. Save all outputs inside `research/`, with `research/research.md` as the canonical report. Every meaningful finding must cite exact file paths, say whether the evidence is `source-confirmed`, `README-documented`, `benchmark-documented`, or mixed, explain why it matters for `Code_Environment/Public`, classify the recommendation as `adopt now`, `prototype later`, or `reject`, identify the affected subsystem, and note migration or truthfulness risk. When research is complete, update `checklist.md`, create `implementation-summary.md`, and save memory with:
    ```bash
    cd /Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public && node .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/dist/memory/generate-context.js "/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace"
    ```

## 6. Research Questions

1. What does MemPalace gain from its raw-verbatim "store everything, then make it findable" posture, and where would that improve or conflict with Spec Kit Memory's more selective save and retrieval model?
2. How useful is the wing / hall / room / closet / drawer taxonomy in practice: does it materially improve navigation and recall, or does it mostly reframe metadata filtering in memorable language?
3. How does the L0/L1/L2/L3 wake-up stack compare with Public's `session_bootstrap`, `memory_context`, and compaction-recovery flows, and what parts of the layering model are reusable here?
4. What does `mcp_server.py` gain by embedding `PALACE_PROTOCOL` and `AAAK_SPEC` directly in the status bootstrap, and could Public benefit from similarly direct memory-usage guidance without adding prompt clutter?
5. How effective are the stop-hook and pre-compact-hook patterns at protecting context before loss, and how do they compare to Public's existing compaction-oriented structural plugin and memory-save workflows?
6. What are the real architectural consequences of keeping the temporal knowledge graph separate from the drawer store, especially around invalidation, diary entries, and fact-vs-verbatim boundaries?
7. How much of MemPalace's benchmark story is supported directly by code in this repo, and which claims should remain benchmark candidates or doc-level references rather than implementation truths?
8. How do `miner.py`, `convo_miner.py`, and `general_extractor.py` balance "store everything" against chunking, heuristics, room assignment, and extraction side paths?
9. Which MemPalace ideas most improve compaction survival and startup continuity for future Public sessions: wake-up layers, hook timing, memory protocol bootstrapping, diary writing, or taxonomy-based narrowing?
10. Which MemPalace features are genuinely reusable architecture, and which are presentation choices, experimental layers, or hype-prone claims that Public should not copy?
11. How should AAAK be evaluated honestly: as a useful optional compression dialect, a still-unproven context-loading experiment, or mostly a distraction from the stronger raw-verbatim baseline?

## 7. Do's

- Do distinguish raw verbatim storage from AAAK compression; they are not the same feature and do not have the same evidence quality.
- Do separate palace graph traversal from the temporal knowledge graph; one is metadata-derived navigation and the other is explicit fact storage with validity windows.
- Do inspect the actual hook scripts, not just their README, so the analysis captures the precise blocking behavior before save and compaction.
- Do compare MemPalace's wake-up flow against current Public bootstrap and compaction behavior using real Public files.
- Do treat the April 7, 2026 correction note as important evidence about truthfulness boundaries and product honesty.
- Do analyze how status/bootstrap responses teach the agent what to do, not just what data they return.
- Do map strong findings to specific Public subsystems such as Spec Kit Memory retrieval, context bootstrap, save flows, or compaction handling.

## 8. Don'ts

- Do not describe MemPalace as "just ChromaDB search"; the repo's differentiators are raw-storage posture, wake-up layers, hooks, taxonomy, and KG split.
- Do not treat README benchmark numbers as fully source-proven implementation facts unless the repo actually exposes the relevant pipeline.
- Do not recommend copying AAAK or benchmark marketing language wholesale into Public planning.
- Do not collapse this phase into generic hybrid-RAG analysis already owned by earlier phases.
- Do not ignore the repo's admitted inaccuracies or unresolved claims; they are central to evaluating whether an idea is production-worthy.
- Do not overlook the difference between "AI remembers because storage exists" and "AI remembers because the protocol tells it when and how to use storage."
- Do not edit anything under `external/` or outside this phase folder.

## 9. Examples

### Example A: Wake-up and protocol finding

```text
**Finding: Status doubles as a behavior bootstrap, not just a health check**
- Source: external/mempalace/mcp_server.py; external/mempalace/layers.py
- Evidence type: source-confirmed
- What it does: `mempalace_status` returns palace overview data plus `PALACE_PROTOCOL` and `AAAK_SPEC`, while the wake-up stack separately loads L0/L1 context for cheap startup continuity.
- Why it matters: Public already has resume/bootstrap tooling, but it does not currently use one memory-facing status surface to teach concrete retrieval and save behavior this directly.
- Recommendation: prototype later
- Affected area: memory bootstrap UX, session recovery guidance, compaction recovery behavior
- Risk/cost: Medium; could add prompt noise or duplicate existing guidance if not scoped carefully
```

### Example B: Hook-driven preservation finding

```text
**Finding: Save timing is enforced by hooks, not left to agent initiative alone**
- Source: external/hooks/mempal_save_hook.sh; external/hooks/mempal_precompact_hook.sh; external/hooks/README.md
- Evidence type: source-confirmed + README-documented
- What it does: the stop hook blocks every N human exchanges and the pre-compact hook always blocks, forcing the agent to preserve key context before loss.
- Why it matters: Public has compaction-oriented structural transport, but it does not currently enforce a comparable memory-preservation checkpoint before context collapse.
- Recommendation: adopt now or prototype later, depending on runtime surface
- Affected area: memory save automation, compaction resilience, agent operating protocol
- Risk/cost: Medium; intrusive save prompts and duplicate writes need guardrails
```

## 10. Constraints

### 10.1 Error handling

- If a README or benchmark claim is not directly supported by source, label it clearly as documentation- or benchmark-level evidence rather than implementation fact.
- If MemPalace's docs contradict its code or its own April 2026 correction note, prefer source evidence and call out the contradiction explicitly.
- If comparison assumptions about current `Code_Environment/Public` behavior are outdated, correct them in the research instead of preserving stale framing.
- If the external repo structure differs from the paths named here, preserve the same analytical order and document the actual files used.

### 10.2 Scope

**IN SCOPE**

- raw verbatim storage and no-summary posture
- palace taxonomy: wings, halls, rooms, closets, drawers
- L0/L1/L2/L3 wake-up layering
- MCP server design, status bootstrap, protocol guidance, diary tools
- stop and pre-compact hook behavior
- temporal knowledge graph and invalidation model
- mining modes, chunking, heuristics, onboarding
- benchmark and README truthfulness boundaries
- comparison against current Public memory, bootstrap, save, and compaction flows

**OUT OF SCOPE**

- generic Python style commentary
- speculative cloud scaling or hosted-service redesigns
- broad vector-database taxonomy disconnected from MemPalace evidence
- re-litigating BM25/FSRS/plugin topics already owned by earlier phases
- editing or fixing MemPalace itself

### 10.3 Prioritization framework

Rank findings in this order: leverage for Public session continuity, compaction-survival value, truthfulness and evidence quality, fit with current Spec Kit Memory capabilities, operational simplicity, memory-hygiene impact, and clean differentiation from phases `001` through `004`.

## 11. Deliverables

- `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`, `checklist.md`, and `decision-record.md` present and valid before deep research starts
- `research/research.md` as the canonical report with at least 5 evidence-backed findings
- explicit comparison against current Public memory retrieval, bootstrap, save, and compaction behavior
- each finding labeled `adopt now`, `prototype later`, or `reject`
- each finding states evidence type: `source-confirmed`, `README-documented`, `benchmark-documented`, or mixed
- `implementation-summary.md` created at the end
- memory saved from this phase folder using `generate-context.js`

Minimum finding schema:

- finding title
- exact source evidence
- evidence type
- what MemPalace does
- why it matters for `Code_Environment/Public`
- recommendation: `adopt now`, `prototype later`, or `reject`
- affected subsystem
- migration, ambiguity, or truthfulness risk

## 12. Evaluation Criteria

- CLEAR target: `>= 40/50`
- RICCE compliance is visible in the prompt:
  - **Role** is specialized in verbatim memory systems, wake-up layering, MCP protocol design, hooks, and temporal KG behavior
  - **Instructions** are ordered, concrete, path-specific, and honest about evidence boundaries
  - **Context** is domain-specific, cross-phase aware, and corrected for current Public capabilities
  - **Constraints** clearly separate source-confirmed behavior from README or benchmark claims
  - **Examples** show strong MemPalace-derived findings about protocol bootstrapping and hook-driven preservation
- at least 5 findings are evidence-backed rather than speculative
- findings explicitly separate raw-mode strengths from AAAK's experimental status
- findings compare MemPalace against today's Public bootstrap and compaction behavior rather than a stale baseline
- cross-phase overlap with `001` through `004` is explicitly bounded so this phase stays focused on raw-verbatim architecture, wake-up layers, hooks, and KG split

## 13. Completion Bar

The phase is only complete when all of the following are true:

- the reading order covered README honesty notes, CLI/runtime boundaries, MCP server, retrieval layers, palace graph, temporal KG, ingest pipeline, hooks, and benchmarks
- current `Code_Environment/Public` memory/bootstrap/compaction behavior was compared using code, not assumptions
- the validation command passed on this exact phase folder
- the exact deep-research topic string appears in the work
- `research/research.md` contains at least 5 evidence-backed findings
- each finding distinguishes source-confirmed behavior from README or benchmark claims where needed
- `checklist.md` is updated with evidence and completion marks
- `implementation-summary.md` exists
- memory is saved successfully for `005-mempalace`
- no edits were made outside this phase folder
- recommendations explicitly address raw storage, taxonomy, wake-up layering, hooks, and temporal KG patterns

The phase folder inventory is intact and includes the earlier iteration files through `iteration-034.md`, so I’m grounding this pass against the real artifact set rather than the stale “missing iteration” note from earlier runs. CocoIndex is cancelling in this session again, so I’m continuing with direct source reads and exact grep evidence instead of blocking the research on that tool path.

7:### The highest-scoring AI memory system ever benchmarked. And it's free.
15:**The Palace** — Ancient Greek orators memorized entire speeches by placing ideas in rooms of an imaginary building. Walk through the building, find the idea. MemPalace applies the same principle to AI memory: your conversations are organized into wings (people and projects), halls (types of memory), and rooms (specific ideas). No AI decides what matters — you keep every word, and the structure gives you a navigable map instead of a flat search index.
17:**Raw verbatim storage** — MemPalace stores your actual exchanges in ChromaDB without summarization or extraction. The 96.6% LongMemEval result comes from this raw mode. We don't burn an LLM to decide what's "worth remembering" — we keep everything and let semantic search find it.
19:**AAAK (experimental)** — A lossy abbreviation dialect for packing repeated entities into fewer tokens at scale. Readable by any LLM that reads text — Claude, GPT, Gemini, Llama, Mistral — no decoder needed. **AAAK is a separate compression layer, not the storage default**, and on the LongMemEval benchmark it currently regresses vs raw mode (84.2% vs 96.6%).

52:## A Note from Milla & Ben — April 7, 2026
58:> - **The AAAK token example was incorrect.** We used a rough heuristic (`len(text)//3`) for token counts instead of an actual tokenizer. Real counts via OpenAI's tokenizer: the English example is 66 tokens, the AAAK example is 73. AAAK does not save tokens at small scales — it's designed for *repeated entities at scale*, and the README example was a bad demonstration of that. We're rewriting it.
60:> - **"30x lossless compression" was overstated.** AAAK is a lossy abbreviation system (entity codes, sentence truncation). Independent benchmarks show AAAK mode scores **84.2% R@5 vs raw mode's 96.6%** on LongMemEval — a 12.4 point regression. The honest framing is: AAAK is an experimental compression layer that trades fidelity for token density, and **the 96.6% headline number is from RAW mode, not AAAK**.
62:> - **"+34% palace boost" was misleading.** That number compares unfiltered search to wing+room metadata filtering. Metadata filtering is a standard ChromaDB feature, not a novel retrieval mechanism. Real and useful, but not a moat.
66:> - **"100% with Haiku rerank"** is real (we have the result files) but the rerank pipeline is not in the public benchmark scripts. We're adding it.
70:> - **96.6% R@5 on LongMemEval in raw mode**, on 500 questions, zero API calls — independently reproduced on M2 Ultra in under 5 minutes by [@gizmax](https://github.com/milla-jovovich/mempalace/issues/39).
72:> - The architecture (wings, rooms, closets, drawers) is real and useful, even if it's not a magical retrieval boost.
76:> 1. Rewriting the AAAK example with real tokenizer counts and a scenario where AAAK actually demonstrates compression
77:> 2. Adding `mode raw / aaak / rooms` clearly to the benchmark documentation so the trade-offs are visible
87:## Quick Start
111:## How You Actually Use It
126:### With Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, Gemini (MCP-compatible tools)
133:Now your AI has 19 tools available through MCP. Ask it anything:
143:Local models generally don't speak MCP yet. Two approaches:
148:mempalace wake-up > context.txt
152:This gives your local model ~170 tokens of critical facts (in AAAK if you prefer) before you ask a single question.
169:Either way — your entire memory stack runs offline. ChromaDB on your machine, Llama on your machine, AAAK for compression, zero cloud calls.
183:| **MemPalace wake-up** | **~170 tokens** | **~$0.70/yr** |
186:MemPalace loads 170 tokens of critical facts on wake-up — your team, your projects, your preferences. Then searches only when needed. $10/year to remember everything vs $507/year for summaries that lose context.
192:### The Palace
198:Each wing has **rooms** connected to it, where information is divided into subjects that relate to that wing — so every room is a different element of what your project contains. Project ideas could be one room, employees could be another, financial statements another. There can be an endless number of rooms that split the wing into sections. The MemPalace install detects these for you automatically, and of course you can personalize it any way you feel is right.
200:Every room has a **closet** connected to it, and here's where things get interesting. We've developed an AI language called **AAAK**. Don't ask — it's a whole story of its own. Your agent learns the AAAK shorthand every time it wakes up. Because AAAK is essentially English, but a very truncated version, your agent understands how to use it in seconds. It comes as part of the install, built into the MemPalace code. In our next update, we'll add AAAK directly to the closets, which will be a real game changer — the amount of info in the closets will be much bigger, but it will take up far less space and far less reading time for your agent.
202:Inside those closets are **drawers**, and those drawers are where your original files live. In this first version, we haven't used AAAK as a closet tool, but even so, the summaries have shown **96.6% recall** in all the benchmarks we've done across multiple benchmarking platforms. Once the closets use AAAK, searches will be even faster while keeping every word exact. But even now, the closet approach has been a huge boon to how much info is stored in a small space — it's used to easily point your AI agent to the drawer where your original file lives. You never lose anything, and all this happens in seconds.
204:There are also **halls**, which connect rooms within a wing, and **tunnels**, which connect rooms from different wings to one another. So finding things becomes truly effortless — we've given the AI a clean and organized way to know where to start searching, without having to look through every keyword in huge folders.
218:  │    │  Closet  │ ───▶ │  Drawer  │                          │
233:  │    │  Closet  │ ───▶ │  Drawer  │                          │
239:**Rooms** — specific topics within a wing. Auth, billing, deploy — endless rooms.
240:**Halls** — connections between related rooms *within* the same wing. If Room A (auth) and Room B (security) are related, a hall links them.
241:**Tunnels** — connections *between* wings. When Person A and a Project both have a room about "auth," a tunnel cross-references them automatically.
242:**Closets** — summaries that point to the original content. (In v3.0.0 these are plain-text summaries; AAAK-encoded closets are coming in a future update — see [Task #30](https://github.com/milla-jovovich/mempalace/issues/30).)
243:**Drawers** — the original verbatim files. The exact words, never summarized.
252:**Rooms** are named ideas — `auth-migration`, `graphql-switch`, `ci-pipeline`. When the same room appears in different wings, it creates a **tunnel** — connecting the same topic across domains:
260:Same room. Three wings. The tunnel connects them.
270:Search wing + room:          94.8%  (+34%)
273:Wings and rooms aren't cosmetic. They're a **34% retrieval improvement**. The palace structure is the product.
280:| **L1** | Critical facts — team, projects, preferences | ~120 tokens (AAAK) | Always loaded |
286:### AAAK Dialect (experimental)
288:AAAK is a lossy abbreviation system — entity codes, structural markers, and sentence truncation — designed to pack repeated entities and relationships into fewer tokens at scale. It is **readable by any LLM that reads text** (Claude, GPT, Gemini, Llama, Mistral) without a decoder, so a local model can use it without any cloud dependency.
292:- **AAAK is lossy, not lossless.** It uses regex-based abbreviation, not reversible compression.
293:- **It does not save tokens at small scales.** Short text already tokenizes efficiently. AAAK overhead (codes, separators) costs more than it saves on a few sentences.
295:- **AAAK currently regresses LongMemEval** vs raw verbatim retrieval (84.2% R@5 vs 96.6%). The 96.6% headline number is from **raw mode**, not AAAK mode.
296:- **The MemPalace storage default is raw verbatim text in ChromaDB** — that's where the benchmark wins come from. AAAK is a separate compression layer for context loading, not the storage format.
431:- **Keeps a diary** — written in AAAK, persists across sessions

    52	## A Note from Milla & Ben — April 7, 2026
    53	
    54	> The community caught real problems in this README within hours of launch and we want to address them directly.
    55	>
    56	> **What we got wrong:**
    57	>
    58	> - **The AAAK token example was incorrect.** We used a rough heuristic (`len(text)//3`) for token counts instead of an actual tokenizer. Real counts via OpenAI's tokenizer: the English example is 66 tokens, the AAAK example is 73. AAAK does not save tokens at small scales — it's designed for *repeated entities at scale*, and the README example was a bad demonstration of that. We're rewriting it.
    59	>
    60	> - **"30x lossless compression" was overstated.** AAAK is a lossy abbreviation system (entity codes, sentence truncation). Independent benchmarks show AAAK mode scores **84.2% R@5 vs raw mode's 96.6%** on LongMemEval — a 12.4 point regression. The honest framing is: AAAK is an experimental compression layer that trades fidelity for token density, and **the 96.6% headline number is from RAW mode, not AAAK**.
    61	>
    62	> - **"+34% palace boost" was misleading.** That number compares unfiltered search to wing+room metadata filtering. Metadata filtering is a standard ChromaDB feature, not a novel retrieval mechanism. Real and useful, but not a moat.
    63	>
    64	> - **"Contradiction detection"** exists as a separate utility (`fact_checker.py`) but is not currently wired into the knowledge graph operations as the README implied.
    65	>
    66	> - **"100% with Haiku rerank"** is real (we have the result files) but the rerank pipeline is not in the public benchmark scripts. We're adding it.
    67	>
    68	> **What's still true and reproducible:**
    69	>
    70	> - **96.6% R@5 on LongMemEval in raw mode**, on 500 questions, zero API calls — independently reproduced on M2 Ultra in under 5 minutes by [@gizmax](https://github.com/milla-jovovich/mempalace/issues/39).
    71	> - Local, free, no subscription, no cloud, no data leaving your machine.
    72	> - The architecture (wings, rooms, closets, drawers) is real and useful, even if it's not a magical retrieval boost.
    73	>
    74	> **What we're doing:**
    75	>
    76	> 1. Rewriting the AAAK example with real tokenizer counts and a scenario where AAAK actually demonstrates compression
    77	> 2. Adding `mode raw / aaak / rooms` clearly to the benchmark documentation so the trade-offs are visible
    78	> 3. Wiring `fact_checker.py` into the KG ops so the contradiction detection claim becomes true
    79	> 4. Pinning ChromaDB to a tested range (Issue #100), fixing the shell injection in hooks (#110), and addressing the macOS ARM64 segfault (#74)

   192	### The Palace
   193	
   194	The layout is fairly simple, though it took a long time to get there.
   195	
   196	It starts with a **wing**. Every project, person, or topic you're filing gets its own wing in the palace.
   197	
   198	Each wing has **rooms** connected to it, where information is divided into subjects that relate to that wing — so every room is a different element of what your project contains. Project ideas could be one room, employees could be another, financial statements another. There can be an endless number of rooms that split the wing into sections. The MemPalace install detects these for you automatically, and of course you can personalize it any way you feel is right.
   199	
   200	Every room has a **closet** connected to it, and here's where things get interesting. We've developed an AI language called **AAAK**. Don't ask — it's a whole story of its own. Your agent learns the AAAK shorthand every time it wakes up. Because AAAK is essentially English, but a very truncated version, your agent understands how to use it in seconds. It comes as part of the install, built into the MemPalace code. In our next update, we'll add AAAK directly to the closets, which will be a real game changer — the amount of info in the closets will be much bigger, but it will take up far less space and far less reading time for your agent.
   201	
   202	Inside those closets are **drawers**, and those drawers are where your original files live. In this first version, we haven't used AAAK as a closet tool, but even so, the summaries have shown **96.6% recall** in all the benchmarks we've done across multiple benchmarking platforms. Once the closets use AAAK, searches will be even faster while keeping every word exact. But even now, the closet approach has been a huge boon to how much info is stored in a small space — it's used to easily point your AI agent to the drawer where your original file lives. You never lose anything, and all this happens in seconds.
   203	
   204	There are also **halls**, which connect rooms within a wing, and **tunnels**, which connect rooms from different wings to one another. So finding things becomes truly effortless — we've given the AI a clean and organized way to know where to start searching, without having to look through every keyword in huge folders.
   205	
   206	You say what you're looking for and boom, it already knows which wing to go to. Just *that* in itself would have made a big difference. But this is beautiful, elegant, organic, and most importantly, efficient.
   280	| **L1** | Critical facts — team, projects, preferences | ~120 tokens (AAAK) | Always loaded |
   281	| **L2** | Room recall — recent sessions, current project | On demand | When topic comes up |
   282	| **L3** | Deep search — semantic query across all closets | On demand | When explicitly asked |
   283	
   284	Your AI wakes up with L0 + L1 (~170 tokens) and knows your world. Searches only fire when needed.
   285	
   286	### AAAK Dialect (experimental)
   287	
   288	AAAK is a lossy abbreviation system — entity codes, structural markers, and sentence truncation — designed to pack repeated entities and relationships into fewer tokens at scale. It is **readable by any LLM that reads text** (Claude, GPT, Gemini, Llama, Mistral) without a decoder, so a local model can use it without any cloud dependency.
   289	
   290	**Honest status (April 2026):**
   291	
   292	- **AAAK is lossy, not lossless.** It uses regex-based abbreviation, not reversible compression.
   293	- **It does not save tokens at small scales.** Short text already tokenizes efficiently. AAAK overhead (codes, separators) costs more than it saves on a few sentences.
   294	- **It can save tokens at scale** — in scenarios with many repeated entities (a team mentioned hundreds of times, the same project across thousands of sessions), the entity codes amortize.
   295	- **AAAK currently regresses LongMemEval** vs raw verbatim retrieval (84.2% R@5 vs 96.6%). The 96.6% headline number is from **raw mode**, not AAAK mode.
   296	- **The MemPalace storage default is raw verbatim text in ChromaDB** — that's where the benchmark wins come from. AAAK is a separate compression layer for context loading, not the storage format.
   297	
   298	We're iterating on the dialect spec, adding a real tokenizer for stats, and exploring better break points for when to use it. Track progress in [Issue #43](https://github.com/milla-jovovich/mempalace/issues/43) and [#27](https://github.com/milla-jovovich/mempalace/issues/27).

I’ve got the core MemPalace evidence now: the runtime boundary is small and concrete, the MCP server really does embed a behavior protocol in `status`, and the layering/graph/KG pieces are separable in source. I’m drilling into the exact line ranges for retrieval layers, hook behavior, and the matching Public handlers so the compatibility analysis can call out real collision points instead of repo-level generalities.

     2	knowledge_graph.py — Temporal Entity-Relationship Graph for MemPalace
     3	=====================================================================
     4	
     5	Real knowledge graph with:
     6	  - Entity nodes (people, projects, tools, concepts)
     7	  - Typed relationship edges (daughter_of, does, loves, works_on, etc.)
     8	  - Temporal validity (valid_from → valid_to — knows WHEN facts are true)
     9	  - Closet references (links back to the verbatim memory)
    10	
    11	Storage: SQLite (local, no dependencies, no subscriptions)
    12	Query: entity-first traversal with time filtering
    13	
    14	This is what competes with Zep's temporal knowledge graph.
    15	Zep uses Neo4j in the cloud ($25/mo+). We use SQLite locally (free).
    16	
    17	Usage:

     1	# MemPalace Hooks — Auto-Save for Terminal AI Tools
     2	
     3	These hook scripts make MemPalace save automatically. No manual "save" commands needed.
     4	
     5	## What They Do
     6	
     7	| Hook | When It Fires | What Happens |
     8	|------|--------------|-------------|
     9	| **Save Hook** | Every 15 human messages | Blocks the AI, tells it to save key topics/decisions/quotes to the palace |
    10	| **PreCompact Hook** | Right before context compaction | Emergency save — forces the AI to save EVERYTHING before losing context |
    11	
    12	The AI does the actual filing — it knows the conversation context, so it classifies memories into the right wings/halls/closets. The hooks just tell it WHEN to save.
    13	
    14	## Install — Claude Code
    15	
    16	Add to `.claude/settings.local.json`:
    17	
    18	```json
    19	{
    20	  "hooks": {
    21	    "Stop": [{
    22	      "matcher": "*",
    23	      "hooks": [{
    24	        "type": "command",

    26	        "timeout": 30

    34	      }]
    35	    }]
    36	  }
    37	}
    38	```
    39	
    40	Make them executable:
    41	```bash
    42	chmod +x hooks/mempal_save_hook.sh hooks/mempal_precompact_hook.sh
    43	```
    44	
    45	## Install — Codex CLI (OpenAI)
    46	
    47	Add to `.codex/hooks.json`:
    48	
    49	```json
    50	{
    51	  "Stop": [{
    52	    "type": "command",
    53	    "command": "/absolute/path/to/hooks/mempal_save_hook.sh",
    54	    "timeout": 30
    55	  }],
    56	  "PreCompact": [{
    57	    "type": "command",
    58	    "command": "/absolute/path/to/hooks/mempal_precompact_hook.sh",
    59	    "timeout": 30
    60	  }]
    61	}
    62	```
    63	
    64	## Configuration
    65	
    66	Edit `mempal_save_hook.sh` to change:
    67	
    68	- **`SAVE_INTERVAL=15`** — How many human messages between saves. Lower = more frequent saves, higher = less interruption.
    69	- **`STATE_DIR`** — Where hook state is stored (defaults to `~/.mempalace/hook_state/`)
    70	- **`MEMPAL_DIR`** — Optional. Set to a conversations directory to auto-run `mempalace mine <dir>` on each save trigger. Leave blank (default) to let the AI handle saving via the block reason message.
    71	
    72	### mempalace CLI
    73	
    74	The relevant commands are:
    75	
    76	```bash
    77	mempalace mine <dir>               # Mine all files in a directory
    78	mempalace mine <dir> --mode convos # Mine conversation transcripts only
    79	```
    80	
    81	The hooks resolve the repo root automatically from their own path, so they work regardless of where you install the repo.
    82	
    83	## How It Works (Technical)
    84	
    85	### Save Hook (Stop event)
    86	
    87	```
    88	User sends message → AI responds → Claude Code fires Stop hook
    89	                                            ↓
    90	                                    Hook counts human messages in JSONL transcript
    91	                                            ↓
    92	                              ┌─── < 15 since last save ──→ echo "{}" (let AI stop)
    93	                              │
    94	                              └─── ≥ 15 since last save ──→ {"decision": "block", "reason": "save..."}
    95	                                                                    ↓
    96	                                                            AI saves to palace
    97	                                                                    ↓
    98	                                                            AI tries to stop again
    99	                                                                    ↓
   100	                                                            stop_hook_active = true
   101	                                                                    ↓
   102	                                                            Hook sees flag → echo "{}" (let it through)
   103	```
   104	
   105	The `stop_hook_active` flag prevents infinite loops: block once → AI saves → tries to stop → flag is true → we let it through.
   106	
   107	### PreCompact Hook
   108	
   109	```
   110	Context window getting full → Claude Code fires PreCompact
   111	                                        ↓
   112	                                Hook ALWAYS blocks
   113	                                        ↓
   114	                                AI saves everything
   115	                                        ↓
   116	                                Compaction proceeds
   117	```
   118	
   119	No counting needed — compaction always warrants a save.
   120	
   121	## Debugging
   122	
   123	Check the hook log:
   124	```bash
   125	cat ~/.mempalace/hook_state/hook.log
   126	```
   127	
   128	Example output:
   129	```
   130	[14:30:15] Session abc123: 12 exchanges, 12 since last save
   131	[14:35:22] Session abc123: 15 exchanges, 15 since last save
   132	[14:35:22] TRIGGERING SAVE at exchange 15
   133	[14:40:01] Session abc123: 18 exchanges, 3 since last save
   134	```
   135	
   136	## Cost
   137	
   138	**Zero extra tokens.** The hooks are bash scripts that run locally. They don't call any API. The only "cost" is the AI spending a few seconds organizing memories at each checkpoint — and it's doing that with context it already has loaded.

16:**MemPal's baseline just stores the actual words and searches them with ChromaDB's default embeddings. No extraction. No summarization. No AI deciding what matters. And it scores 96.6% on LongMemEval.**
18:That's the finding. The field is over-engineering the memory extraction step. Raw verbatim text with good embeddings is a stronger baseline than anyone realized — because it doesn't lose information. When an LLM extracts "user prefers PostgreSQL" and throws away the original conversation, it loses the context of *why*, the alternatives considered, the tradeoffs discussed. MemPal keeps all of that, and the search model finds it.
28:| Mode | LongMemEval R@5 | LLM Required | Cost per Query |
30:| **Raw ChromaDB** | **96.6%** | None | $0 |
31:| **Hybrid v4 + Haiku rerank** | **100%** | Haiku (optional) | ~$0.001 |
32:| **Hybrid v4 + Sonnet rerank** | **100%** | Sonnet (optional) | ~$0.003 |
34:The 96.6% is the product story: free, private, one dependency, no API key, runs entirely offline.
36:The 100% is the competitive story: a perfect score on the standard benchmark for AI memory, verified across all 500 questions and all 6 question types — reproducible with either Haiku or Sonnet as the reranker.
42:## Comparison vs Published Systems (LongMemEval)
46:| 1 | **MemPal (hybrid v4 + rerank)** | **100%** | Optional | Haiku | Reproducible, 500/500 |
48:| 3 | MemPal (hybrid v3 + rerank) | 99.4% | Optional | Haiku | Reproducible |
49:| 3 | MemPal (palace + rerank) | 99.4% | Optional | Haiku | Independent architecture |
51:| 5 | **MemPal (raw, no LLM)** | **96.6%** | **None** | **None** | **Highest zero-API score published** |
58:**MemPal raw (96.6%) is the highest published LongMemEval score that requires no API key, no cloud, and no LLM at any stage.**
60:**MemPal hybrid v4 + Haiku rerank (100%) is the first perfect score on LongMemEval — 500/500 questions, all 6 question types at 100%.**
75:MemPal is more than 2× Mem0 on this benchmark. With Sonnet rerank, MemPal reaches **100% on LoCoMo** across all 5 question types including temporal-inference (was 46% at baseline).
83:| Assistant Facts | 100% | Perfect |
89:### LoCoMo (1,986 multi-hop QA pairs)
93:| **Hybrid v5 + Sonnet rerank (top-50)** | **100%** | **100%** | Sonnet | Structurally guaranteed (top-k > sessions) |
94:| **bge-large + Haiku rerank (top-15)** | — | **96.3%** | Haiku | Single-hop 86.6%, temporal-inf 87.0% |
99:| **Palace v2 (top-10, 3 rooms)** | 75.6% | **84.8%** | Haiku (index) | Room assignment at index; summary routing at query |
101:| Palace v1 (top-5, global LLM routing) | 34.2% | — | Haiku (both) | Fails: taxonomy mismatch |
102:| Session, no rerank (top-10) | — | 60.3% | None | Baseline |
103:| Dialog, no rerank (top-10) | — | 48.0% | None | — |
127:Root cause of wings v1 failure: (1) speaker WHERE filter discarded evidence about Caroline when evidence lived in a John-tagged closet (John spoke more words but conversation was about Caroline); (2) top_k=10 from ~184 closets = 5.4% coverage vs 37% in session mode. Fix: retrieve all closets, use speaker match as 15% distance boost instead of filter.
129:**With Sonnet rerank, MemPal achieves 100% on every LoCoMo question type — including temporal-inference, which was the hardest category at baseline.**
131:**Per-category breakdown (hybrid + Sonnet rerank):**
141:**Temporal-inference was the hardest category** — questions requiring connections across multiple sessions. Hybrid scoring (person name boost, quoted phrase boost) combined with Sonnet's reading comprehension closes this gap entirely. From 46% to 100%.
145:## LongMemEval — Breakdown by Question Type
147:The 96.6% R@5 baseline broken down by the six question categories in LongMemEval:
151:| Knowledge update | 99.0% | 100% | 78 | Strongest — facts that changed over time |
152:| Multi-session | 98.5% | 100% | 133 | Very strong |
162:Both were addressed in the improvements that took the score from 96.6% to 99.4%.
166:## The Full Progression — How We Got from 96.6% to 99.4%
170:### Starting Point: Raw ChromaDB (96.6%)
174:This was the first result. Nobody expected it to work this well. The team's hypothesis was that raw verbatim storage would lose to systems that extract structured facts. The 96.6% proved the hypothesis wrong.
208:**Why it worked:** Many LongMemEval questions are anchored to a specific time ("what did you do last month?"). Multiple sessions might semantically match, but only one is temporally correct. The boost breaks ties in favor of the right time period.
212:### Improvement 3: Hybrid v2 + Haiku Rerank → 98.8% (+0.4%)
214:**What changed:** After retrieval, send the top-K candidates to Claude Haiku with the question. Ask Haiku to re-rank by relevance.
216:**Why it worked:** Embeddings measure semantic similarity, not answer relevance. Haiku can read the question and the retrieved documents and reason about which one actually answers the question — a task embeddings fundamentally cannot do.
218:**Cost:** ~$0.001/query for Haiku. Optional — the system runs fine without it.
222:### Improvement 4: Hybrid v3 + Haiku Rerank → 99.4% (+0.6%)
233:**Why 16 patterns:** Manual analysis of the miss cases. Each pattern corresponds to a real failure mode found in the wrong-answer JSONL files.
237:### Improvement 5: Hybrid v4 + Haiku Rerank → **100%** (+0.6%)
239:**What changed:** Three targeted fixes for the three questions that failed in every previous mode.
247:Sentence-embedded models give insufficient weight to person names. Capitalized proper nouns are extracted from queries; sessions mentioning that name get a 40% distance reduction. The target session jumped from unranked to rank 2.
252:**Result:** All 6 question types at 100% R@5. 500/500 questions. No regressions.
254:**Haiku vs. Sonnet rerank:** Both achieve 100% R@5. NDCG@10 is 0.976 (Haiku) vs 0.975 (Sonnet) — statistically identical. Haiku is ~3× cheaper. Sonnet is slightly faster at this task (2.99s/q vs 3.85s/q in our run). Either works; Haiku is the default recommendation.
258:### Parallel Approach: Palace Mode + Haiku Rerank → 99.4% (independent convergence)
279:**What it adds:** At ingest time, Claude Haiku reads each session and generates topic summaries and category labels. These become synthetic documents alongside the verbatim session.
285:**Current status:** 98% cache coverage (18,803 of 19,195 sessions pre-computed). The overnight cache build is complete. Full benchmark run pending — expected to reach ≥99.4% once asymmetry from the remaining ~2% uncovered sessions is eliminated.

423:| **MemPal** | Raw verbatim text + ChromaDB | 96.6% / 100% | Python + ChromaDB | Open source — 100% LME + 100% LoCoMo w/ rerank |
427:| Mem0 | LLM fact extraction | 30–45% (ConvoMem) | LLM API | Popular, weak on benchmarks |
428:| OpenViking | Filesystem-paradigm context DB | Not published | Go + Rust + C++ + VLM | ByteDance; tested on LoCoMo10 only |
432:**OpenViking note:** Tested on LoCoMo10 showing 52% task completion and 91% token savings. No LongMemEval scores published. Requires Go, Rust, C++, and a VLM API — highest infrastructure burden of any system here.
443:| Retrieval accuracy | 96.6% (99.4% w/ LLM) | 91–99% | Not published |
453:The 96.6% raw baseline is fully clean. No heuristics were tuned on the test set. Store verbatim text, query with ChromaDB's default embeddings, score. Exactly reproducible.
455:The hybrid v4 improvements (quoted phrase boost, person name boost, nostalgia patterns) were developed by directly examining the three specific questions that failed in every prior mode:
461:**This is teaching to the test.** The fixes were designed around the exact failure cases, not discovered by analyzing general failure patterns. The 100% result on those three questions is not a clean generalization — it's proof the specific fixes work on those specific questions.
465:### What the 100% result actually means
467:The 96.6% → 99.4% improvements (hybrid v1–v3) are honest improvements: each was motivated by a category of failures, not specific questions. The 99.4% → 100% hybrid v4 step is three targeted fixes for three known failures.
477:A proper split has been created: `benchmarks/lme_split_50_450.json` (seed=42).
485:python benchmarks/longmemeval_bench.py data/... --create-split --split-file benchmarks/lme_split_50_450.json

491:python benchmarks/longmemeval_bench.py data/... --mode hybrid_v4 --held-out --split-file benchmarks/lme_split_50_450.json
494:**The honest next number to publish is the held-out score on a fresh mode that was tuned on dev data only.** Anything else is contaminated.
496:### LoCoMo 100% — a separate caveat
498:The LoCoMo 100% result with top-k=50 has a structural issue: each of the 10 conversations has 19–32 sessions, but top-k=50 exceeds that count. This means the ground-truth session is always in the candidate pool regardless of the embedding model's ranking. The Sonnet rerank is essentially doing reading comprehension over all sessions — the embedding retrieval step is bypassed entirely.
500:**The honest LoCoMo score is the top-10 result: 60.3% without rerank.** A re-run at top-k=10 with the hybrid mode and rerank is the next step for a publishable LoCoMo result.
506:**The scripts are deterministic.** Same data + same script = same result every time. ChromaDB's embeddings are deterministic. The benchmark uses a fixed dataset with no randomness.
508:**The data is public.** LongMemEval, LoCoMo, and ConvoMem are all published academic datasets. Links are in the scripts.
510:**The results are auditable.** Every result JSONL file in `benchmarks/results_*.jsonl` contains every question, every retrieved document, every score. You can inspect every individual answer — not just the aggregate.
514:**The LLM rerank is optional, not required.** The 96.6% baseline needs no API key at any stage — not for indexing, not for retrieval, not for scoring. The 99.4% result adds an optional Haiku rerank step that costs approximately $0.001 per question. This is standard practice: Supermemory ASMR, Mastra, and Hindsight all use LLMs in their retrieval pipelines.

570:- knowledge-update: 100% (69/69)
571:- multi-session: 100% (115/115)
572:- single-session-assistant: 100% (54/54)
574:- single-session-user: 100% (63/63)
575:- temporal-reasoning: 100% (124/124)
577:**Conclusion:** hybrid_v4's improvements generalize. 98.4% on unseen data vs 100% on the contaminated dev set — a 1.6pp gap. The fixes are real, not overfit. The honest claim is "98.4% R@5 on a clean held-out set, 99.8% R@10."
583:### LoCoMo hybrid_v5 — honest top-10 (no rerank)
587:The v5 fix: extracted person names from keyword overlap scoring. In LoCoMo, both speakers' names appear in every session — including them in keyword boosting gave equal signal to all sessions. Removing them lets predicate keywords ("research", "career") do the actual work.
598:Beats Memori (81.95%) by 7pp with no reranking. Result file: `results_locomo_hybrid_session_top10_*.json`
602:### LoCoMo palace mode — LLM room assignment (RESULTS)
604:**Architecture v1 (global taxonomy routing):** Haiku assigns each session to a room at index time. At query time, Haiku routes question to 1-2 rooms. **Result: 34.2% R@5** — 62.5% zero-recall. Failure: independent LLM calls with no shared context produced terminology mismatch between index-time labels and query-time routing.
606:**Architecture v2 (conversation-specific routing):** Same room assignments at index time. At query time, route using keyword overlap against per-room aggregated session summaries — the *same text* used to generate the labels. No LLM calls at query time. **Result: 84.8% R@10 (3 rooms), 75.6% R@5.**
611:| v2: summary-based routing, top-2 rooms | 71.7% | 77.9% | 17.8% | Big fix |
612:| **v2: summary-based routing, top-3 rooms** | **75.6%** | **84.8%** | **11.0%** | Best palace result |
613:| Hybrid v5 (no rooms) | 83.7% | 88.9% | — | Comparison baseline |

688:### 2. bge-large raw baseline (no heuristics, better embeddings)

700:### 3. Honest LoCoMo — hybrid at top-10

I’m at the synthesis stage now. I’ve got enough line-level evidence to separate “compatible with our stack,” “adaptable with guardrails,” and “actively conflicting with Public’s current authority boundaries,” so I’m checking the last two iterations one more time to keep the novelty score honest before I write the iteration output.

    35	ACCUMULATED FINDINGS SUMMARY:
    36	ckgrounded in the stop hook and synchronous only if `MEMPAL_DIR` is configured. The write path itself is weakly protected: `mempalace_add_drawer` uses deterministic IDs, but it does not actually call the semantic duplicate checker before writing.
    37	- **Why it matters for us**: If we copy this pattern into Public, the biggest failure mode is a false sense of safety: the runtime is interrupted, but preservation quality still depends on the model following instructions correctly. That can yield duplicated memories, noisy categorization, partial saves, or blocked UX with no durable improvement. Public’s current compaction transport and JSON-primary `generate-context.js` path are much more deterministic.
    38	- **Recommendation**: prototype later
    39	- **Impact**: high
    40	## Findings

    55	- **Source**: [mempal_save_hook.sh](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/hooks/mempal_save_hook.sh#L129); [mempal_precompact_hook.sh](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/hooks/mempal_precompact_hook.sh#L64); [mcp_server.py](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/mcp_server.py#L326); [generate-context.js](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/dist/memory/generate-context.js#L85); [spec-kit-compact-code-graph.js](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/plugins/spec-kit-compact-code-graph.js#L396)
    56	- **What it does**: MemPalace blocks every 15 user turns and always blocks before compaction, then tells the AI to save; optional auto-ingest is backgrounded in the stop hook and synchronous only if `MEMPAL_DIR` is configured. The write path itself is weakly protected: `mempalace_add_drawer` uses deterministic IDs, but it does not actually call the semantic duplicate checker before writing.
    57	- **Why it matters for us**: If we copy this pattern into Public, the biggest failure mode is a false sense of safety: the runtime is interrupted, but preservation quality still depends on the model following instructions correctly. That can yield duplicated memories, noisy categorization, partial saves, or blocked UX with no durable improvement. Public’s current compaction transport and JSON-primary `generate-context.js` path are much more deterministic.

   154	
   155	## Assessment
   156	- **New information ratio**: 0.12
   157	- **Questions addressed**: phased sequencing, dependency ordering, what to keep out of the roadmap
   158	- **Questions answered**: Q1 should be deterministic preservation plus protocol plus observability; Q2 should stay scoped to evidence retention and wake-up retrieval; Q3 should isolate temporal facts as a sidecar
   159	- **Novelty justification**: This pass adds delivery sequencing and dependency structure on top of the settled 30-iteration recommendation set rather than introducing new primitives.
   160	- **Operational note**: strict validation passed for the phase folder, but the validator reported a temp-file warning under the read-only sandbox, and I could not write this draft back to `research/research.md` or create the missing spec artifacts.
   161	
   162	## Ruled Out
   163	- Forced hook-blocking saves as the primary preservation mechanism because they interrupt the runtime without guaranteeing high-quality capture.
   164	- AAAK-first recall because the repo’s own April 7, 2026 correction and benchmark notes mark it as lossy and worse than raw mode.
   165	- Full palace taxonomy as core Public architecture because the practical value is in disciplined filters and hints, not the metaphor itself.
   166	
   167	## Reflection
   168	- **What worked**: Using the final synthesis block in [research.md#L290535](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/research/research.md#L290535) as the base and then re-checking the underlying source lines made the roadmap stable and low-drift.
   169	- **What did not work**: The phase folder is not actually in the Level 3-on-disk state described by the prompt, so I could not turn this into a persisted packet update in this session.
   170	- **What I would do differently**: Next pass should write this draft into `research/research.md`, update the checklist and implementation summary, and convert the roadmap into concrete follow-on implementation phases.
   171	
   172	## Recommended Next Focus
   173	Translate this roadmap into implementation packets: one Q1 packet for checkpointing and bootstrap hints, one Q1 packet for audit/repair surfaces, one Q2 packet for bounded verbatim evidence plus wake-up profile, and one Q3 packet for the temporal fact sidecar.

   192	## Findings
   193	For EACH finding:
   194	### Finding N: [Title]
   195	- **Novelty justification**: prior iterations identified what to adopt; this pass adds migration-specific breakage modes, rollout flags, and rollback mechanics grounded in current Public code.
   196	- **Operational note**: the exact validator command returned `RESULT: PASSED`, but the packet currently infers as Level 1 and the checkout only contains [research/research.md](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/research/research.md#L1), not the expected Level 3 doc set. I could not persist iteration 32 because the sandbox is read-only.
   197	
   198	## Ruled Out
   199	- MemPalace-style hard blocking as the primary checkpoint mechanism, because it couples preservation to agent compliance.
   200	- A second standalone bootstrap authority, because Public already has `session_bootstrap`, `session_resume`, and startup instructions.
   201	- Raw repair or import flows that bypass `memory_health`, because Public’s current repair contract is bounded and confirmation-gated.
   202	
   203	## Reflection
   204	- **What worked**: anchoring on the final synthesis block first, then validating each adopt-now item against current source lines, kept the migration matrix consistent with the packet’s existing direction.
   205	- **What did not work**: the phase folder is not in the expected on-disk Level 3 state, and the read-only sandbox prevented updating `research/research.md`, `implementation-summary.md`, or memory artifacts.
   206	- **What I would do differently**: next pass should be a write-enabled rollout packet that converts these three findings into implementation phases with explicit flags, metrics, and disable paths.
   207	
   208	## Recommended Next Focus
   209	Create one implementation packet per adopt-now item, with rollout order:
   210	1. compaction checkpoint in advisory mode first,
   211	2. bootstrap hint extension second,
   212	3. audit/repair surfaces third.
   213	
   214	Each packet should ship with a kill switch, a success metric, and a one-command rollback path before any wider enablement.

   137	- **Questions addressed**: phased sequencing, dependency ordering, what to keep out of the roadmap
   138	- **Questions answered**: Q1 should be deterministic preservation plus protocol plus observability; Q2 should stay scoped to evidence retention and wake-up retrieval; Q3 should isolate temporal facts as a sidecar
   139	- **Novelty justification**: This pass adds delivery sequencing and dependency structure on top of the settled 30-iteration recommendation set rather than introducing new primitives.
   140	- **Operational note**: strict validation passed for the phase folder, but the validator reported a temp-file warning under the read-only sandbox, and I could not write this draft back to `research/research.md` or create the missing spec artifacts.
   141	
   142	## Ruled Out
   143	- Forced hook-blocking saves as the primary preservation mechanism because they interrupt the runtime without guaranteeing high-quality capture.
   144	- AAAK-first recall because the repo’s own April 7, 2026 correction and benchmark notes mark it as lossy and worse than raw mode.
   145	- Full palace taxonomy as core Public architecture because the practical value is in disciplined filters and hints, not the metaphor itself.
   146	
   147	## Reflection
   148	- **What worked**: Using the final synthesis block in [research.md#L290535](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/research/research.md#L290535) as the base and then re-checking the underlying source lines made the roadmap stable and low-drift.
   149	- **What did not work**: The phase folder is not actually in the Level 3-on-disk state described by the prompt, so I could not turn this into a persisted packet update in this session.
   150	- **What I would do differently**: Next pass should write this draft into `research/research.md`, update the checklist and implementation summary, and convert the roadmap into concrete follow-on implementation phases.
   151	
   152	## Recommended Next Focus
   153	Translate this roadmap into implementation packets: one Q1 packet for checkpointing and bootstrap hints, one Q1 packet for audit/repair surfaces, one Q2 packet for bounded verbatim evidence plus wake-up profile, and one Q3 packet for the temporal fact sidecar.

   172	## Findings
   173	For EACH finding:
   174	### Finding N: [Title]
   175	- **Novelty justification**: prior iterations identified what to adopt; this pass adds migration-specific breakage modes, rollout flags, and rollback mechanics grounded in current Public code.
   176	- **Operational note**: the exact validator command returned `RESULT: PASSED`, but the packet currently infers as Level 1 and the checkout only contains [research/research.md](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/research/research.md#L1), not the expected Level 3 doc set. I could not persist iteration 32 because the sandbox is read-only.
   177	
   178	## Ruled Out
   179	- MemPalace-style hard blocking as the primary checkpoint mechanism, because it couples preservation to agent compliance.
   180	- A second standalone bootstrap authority, because Public already has `session_bootstrap`, `session_resume`, and startup instructions.
   181	- Raw repair or import flows that bypass `memory_health`, because Public’s current repair contract is bounded and confirmation-gated.
   182	
   183	## Reflection
   184	- **What worked**: anchoring on the final synthesis block first, then validating each adopt-now item against current source lines, kept the migration matrix consistent with the packet’s existing direction.
   185	- **What did not work**: the phase folder is not in the expected on-disk Level 3 state, and the read-only sandbox prevented updating `research/research.md`, `implementation-summary.md`, or memory artifacts.
   186	- **What I would do differently**: next pass should be a write-enabled rollout packet that converts these three findings into implementation phases with explicit flags, metrics, and disable paths.
   187	
   188	## Recommended Next Focus
   189	Create one implementation packet per adopt-now item, with rollout order:
   190	1. compaction checkpoint in advisory mode first,
   191	2. bootstrap hint extension second,
   192	3. audit/repair surfaces third.
   193	
   194	Each packet should ship with a kill switch, a success metric, and a one-command rollback path before any wider enablement.

I’ve finished the evidence pass. I’m packaging this as the iteration-35 artifact in the requested structure, with the compatibility verdict centered on three collision zones: metadata-taxonomy vs real structural tools, hook-driven saving vs Public’s JSON-primary authority, and sidecar fact storage vs existing hybrid retrieval/session machinery.

# Iteration 035: COMPATIBILITY ANALYSIS

## Focus
COMPATIBILITY ANALYSIS: How do the adopted patterns interact with our existing CocoIndex, code-graph, and MCP tool stack? Conflict analysis.

## Findings
### Finding 1: Palace taxonomy is a memory facet, not a substitute for CocoIndex or code-graph
- **Source**: [README.md](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/README.md#L62), [searcher.py](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/searcher.py#L34), [layers.py](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/layers.py#L188), [palace_graph.py](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/palace_graph.py#L15), [context-server.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/context-server.ts#L318), [context-server.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/context-server.ts#L976)
- **What it does**: MemPalace narrows retrieval with Chroma `wing`/`room` filters and builds its graph from shared room metadata, while its own April 7 note admits the touted “palace boost” is mostly standard metadata filtering rather than a novel retrieval engine.
- **Why it matters**: Public already has explicit tool separation: `code_graph_query` for structural relationships and CocoIndex for semantic code search. Reusing wing/room/tunnel language as a primary routing layer for code would compete with stronger, more truthful tools and blur “memory navigation” with “code structure.”
- **Recommendation**: reject
- **Impact**: high
- **Source strength**: primary

### Finding 2: `mempalace_status` is compatible with our MCP stack as a behavior-bootstrap pattern
- **Source**: [mcp_server.py](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/mcp_server.py#L37), [mcp_server.py](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/mcp_server.py#L139), [mcp_server.py](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/mcp_server.py#L169), [mcp_server.py](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/mcp_server.py#L871), [context-server.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/context-server.ts#L684), [context-server.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/context-server.ts#L782)
- **What it does**: MemPalace returns a protocol and dialect spec directly from `status`, and logs to `stderr`, so one MCP read call both bootstraps behavior and stays transport-clean. Public already injects priming, structural, and recommended-call hints through `session_bootstrap` surfaces.
- **Why it matters**: This is one of the cleanest compatibility wins. We do not need a second bootstrap authority, but we can safely make our existing bootstrap/status responses more directive about when to query memory, when to use code-graph, and when to save.
- **Recommendation**: adopt now
- **Impact**: high
- **Source strength**: primary

### Finding 3: Hook-blocking preservation conflicts with Public’s JSON-primary save authority
- **Source**: [hooks/README.md](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/hooks/README.md#L7), [mempal_save_hook.sh](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/hooks/mempal_save_hook.sh#L129), [mempal_precompact_hook.sh](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/hooks/mempal_precompact_hook.sh#L71), [generate-context.js](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/dist/memory/generate-context.js#L85), [generate-context.js](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/dist/memory/generate-context.js#L338), [spec-kit-compact-code-graph.js](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/plugins/spec-kit-compact-code-graph.js#L323), [spec-kit-compact-code-graph.js](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/plugins/spec-kit-compact-code-graph.js#L396)
- **What it does**: MemPalace blocks every 15 user turns and before compaction, then tells the model to save and categorize content. Public already has compaction transport injection plus a strict JSON-primary save path where the AI supplies structured data and the explicit spec-folder target remains authoritative.
- **Why it matters**: Adopting MemPalace’s hook behavior directly would create two competing save authorities: “generic block reason” vs “structured JSON to a named spec folder.” In Public that would weaken determinism, make compaction behavior noisier, and invite partial or mis-scoped saves.
- **Recommendation**: reject
- **Impact**: high
- **Source strength**: primary

### Finding 4: Raw verbatim storage only fits Public as a bounded evidence sidecar
- **Source**: [README.md](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/README.md#L17), [README.md](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/README.md#L296), [miner.py](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/miner.py#L5), [searcher.py](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/searcher.py#L21), [convo_miner.py](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/convo_miner.py#L241), [general_extractor.py](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/general_extractor.py#L363), [memory-search.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/handlers/memory-search.ts#L482), [memory-search.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/handlers/memory-search.ts#L771), [memory-search.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/handlers/memory-search.ts#L1071)
- **What it does**: MemPalace keeps verbatim drawers as the main store and layers heuristics on top for some conversation modes. Public’s primary memory path is already a richer retrieval pipeline with hybrid ranking, constitutional injection, dedup, session state, and response-budget shaping.
- **Why it matters**: Full raw-by-default ingestion would fight our current ranking and token-economy assumptions. The compatible pattern is narrower: keep bounded verbatim evidence or checkpoints alongside the current memory index, not in place of it.
- **Recommendation**: prototype later
- **Impact**: high
- **Source strength**: primary

### Finding 5: The temporal KG is compatible only as a non-authoritative sidecar
- **Source**: [knowledge_graph.py](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/knowledge_graph.py#L5), [knowledge_graph.py](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/knowledge_graph.py#L69), [knowledge_graph.py](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/knowledge_graph.py#L121), [knowledge_graph.py](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/knowledge_graph.py#L180), [mcp_server.py](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/mcp_server.py#L416), [memory-search.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/handlers/memory-search.ts#L521), [memory-search.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/handlers/memory-search.ts#L799)
- **What it does**: MemPalace keeps fact triples in a separate SQLite graph with `valid_from`, `valid_to`, explicit invalidation, and timeline queries, instead of folding temporal facts into Chroma drawers.
- **Why it matters**: This is structurally compatible with Public because it does not require replacing hybrid retrieval. The conflict is authority: if temporal triples start competing with the main memory index or bootstrap hints, the system gets contradictory truth surfaces. If kept sidecar-only, it is a strong fit.
- **Recommendation**: NEW FEATURE
- **Impact**: medium
- **Source strength**: primary

## Assessment
- **New information ratio**: 0.18
- **Questions addressed**: taxonomy vs code-graph/CocoIndex; protocol bootstrap vs existing MCP hints; hook saves vs JSON-primary authority; raw verbatim vs current hybrid retrieval; temporal KG fit
- **Questions answered**: taxonomy should not become a core routing surface; protocol hints are directly portable; blocking hooks conflict as-is; raw verbatim belongs in a bounded sidecar; temporal facts fit only as a separate non-authoritative store
- **Novelty justification**: Earlier passes settled what to adopt; this pass maps those choices onto the actual Public tool boundaries that would accept or reject them.
- **Operational note**: `external/AGENTS.md` exists, and the exact strict validator command returned `RESULT: PASSED`, but the phase still inferred as Level 1 and emitted the temp-file warning under the read-only sandbox, so I could not persist `iteration-035.md`, update `research/research.md`, or create closing artifacts.

## Ruled Out
- Reusing wing/room/tunnel semantics for code navigation, because Public already has stronger authorities for semantic and structural code retrieval.
- MemPalace-style blocking save hooks as the primary preservation mechanism, because they conflict with Public’s structured save contract.
- Treating benchmark claims about rooms or AAAK as compatibility evidence, because the repo itself narrows or corrects those claims.

## Reflection
- **What worked**: Comparing the same concern across paired files, external source on one side and Public runtime files on the other, made compatibility boundaries much clearer than repo-level summaries.
- **What did not work**: CocoIndex MCP search cancelled again in this session, so this iteration had to rely on direct reads and grep-based source tracing.
- **What I would do differently**: The next write-enabled pass should turn this into an explicit authority matrix: which surface owns bootstrap, which owns save, which owns structural lookup, and which sidecars are allowed.

## Recommended Next Focus
Define the implementation authority contract for the three surviving ideas: bootstrap protocol hints, bounded verbatim evidence retention, and a temporal-fact sidecar, with explicit “must not compete with `code_graph_query`, CocoIndex, or JSON-primary `generate-context.js`” rules.

### Finding 1: Palace taxonomy is a memory facet, not a substitute for CocoIndex or code-graph
- **Source**: [README.md](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/README.md#L62), [searcher.py](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/searcher.py#L34), [layers.py](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/layers.py#L188), [palace_graph.py](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/palace_graph.py#L15), [context-server.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/context-server.ts#L318), [context-server.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/context-server.ts#L976)
- **What it does**: MemPalace narrows retrieval with Chroma `wing`/`room` filters and builds its graph from shared room metadata, while its own April 7 note admits the touted “palace boost” is mostly standard metadata filtering rather than a novel retrieval engine.
- **Why it matters**: Public already has explicit tool separation: `code_graph_query` for structural relationships and CocoIndex for semantic code search. Reusing wing/room/tunnel language as a primary routing layer for code would compete with stronger, more truthful tools and blur “memory navigation” with “code structure.”
- **Recommendation**: reject
- **Impact**: high
- **Source strength**: primary

### Finding 2: `mempalace_status` is compatible with our MCP stack as a behavior-bootstrap pattern
- **Source**: [mcp_server.py](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/mcp_server.py#L37), [mcp_server.py](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/mcp_server.py#L139), [mcp_server.py](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/mcp_server.py#L169), [mcp_server.py](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/mcp_server.py#L871), [context-server.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/context-server.ts#L684), [context-server.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/context-server.ts#L782)
- **What it does**: MemPalace returns a protocol and dialect spec directly from `status`, and logs to `stderr`, so one MCP read call both bootstraps behavior and stays transport-clean. Public already injects priming, structural, and recommended-call hints through `session_bootstrap` surfaces.
- **Why it matters**: This is one of the cleanest compatibility wins. We do not need a second bootstrap authority, but we can safely make our existing bootstrap/status responses more directive about when to query memory, when to use code-graph, and when to save.
- **Recommendation**: adopt now
- **Impact**: high
- **Source strength**: primary

### Finding 3: Hook-blocking preservation conflicts with Public’s JSON-primary save authority
- **Source**: [hooks/README.md](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/hooks/README.md#L7), [mempal_save_hook.sh](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/hooks/mempal_save_hook.sh#L129), [mempal_precompact_hook.sh](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/hooks/mempal_precompact_hook.sh#L71), [generate-context.js](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/dist/memory/generate-context.js#L85), [generate-context.js](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/dist/memory/generate-context.js#L338), [spec-kit-compact-code-graph.js](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/plugins/spec-kit-compact-code-graph.js#L323), [spec-kit-compact-code-graph.js](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/plugins/spec-kit-compact-code-graph.js#L396)
- **What it does**: MemPalace blocks every 15 user turns and before compaction, then tells the model to save and categorize content. Public already has compaction transport injection plus a strict JSON-primary save path where the AI supplies structured data and the explicit spec-folder target remains authoritative.
- **Why it matters**: Adopting MemPalace’s hook behavior directly would create two competing save authorities: “generic block reason” vs “structured JSON to a named spec folder.” In Public that would weaken determinism, make compaction behavior noisier, and invite partial or mis-scoped saves.
- **Recommendation**: reject
- **Impact**: high
- **Source strength**: primary

### Finding 4: Raw verbatim storage only fits Public as a bounded evidence sidecar
- **Source**: [README.md](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/README.md#L17), [README.md](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/README.md#L296), [miner.py](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/miner.py#L5), [searcher.py](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/searcher.py#L21), [convo_miner.py](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/convo_miner.py#L241), [general_extractor.py](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/general_extractor.py#L363), [memory-search.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/handlers/memory-search.ts#L482), [memory-search.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/handlers/memory-search.ts#L771), [memory-search.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/handlers/memory-search.ts#L1071)
- **What it does**: MemPalace keeps verbatim drawers as the main store and layers heuristics on top for some conversation modes. Public’s primary memory path is already a richer retrieval pipeline with hybrid ranking, constitutional injection, dedup, session state, and response-budget shaping.
- **Why it matters**: Full raw-by-default ingestion would fight our current ranking and token-economy assumptions. The compatible pattern is narrower: keep bounded verbatim evidence or checkpoints alongside the current memory index, not in place of it.
- **Recommendation**: prototype later
- **Impact**: high
- **Source strength**: primary

### Finding 5: The temporal KG is compatible only as a non-authoritative sidecar
- **Source**: [knowledge_graph.py](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/knowledge_graph.py#L5), [knowledge_graph.py](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/knowledge_graph.py#L69), [knowledge_graph.py](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/knowledge_graph.py#L121), [knowledge_graph.py](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/knowledge_graph.py#L180), [mcp_server.py](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/mcp_server.py#L416), [memory-search.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/handlers/memory-search.ts#L521), [memory-search.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/handlers/memory-search.ts#L799)
- **What it does**: MemPalace keeps fact triples in a separate SQLite graph with `valid_from`, `valid_to`, explicit invalidation, and timeline queries, instead of folding temporal facts into Chroma drawers.
- **Why it matters**: This is structurally compatible with Public because it does not require replacing hybrid retrieval. The conflict is authority: if temporal triples start competing with the main memory index or bootstrap hints, the system gets contradictory truth surfaces. If kept sidecar-only, it is a strong fit.
- **Recommendation**: NEW FEATURE
- **Impact**: medium
- **Source strength**: primary

## Assessment
- **New information ratio**: 0.18
- **Questions addressed**: taxonomy vs code-graph/CocoIndex; protocol bootstrap vs existing MCP hints; hook saves vs JSON-primary authority; raw verbatim vs current hybrid retrieval; temporal KG fit
- **Questions answered**: taxonomy should not become a core routing surface; protocol hints are directly portable; blocking hooks conflict as-is; raw verbatim belongs in a bounded sidecar; temporal facts fit only as a separate non-authoritative store
- **Novelty justification**: Earlier passes settled what to adopt; this pass maps those choices onto the actual Public tool boundaries that would accept or reject them.
- **Operational note**: `external/AGENTS.md` exists, and the exact strict validator command returned `RESULT: PASSED`, but the phase still inferred as Level 1 and emitted the temp-file warning under the read-only sandbox, so I could not persist `iteration-035.md`, update `research/research.md`, or create closing artifacts.

## Ruled Out
- Reusing wing/room/tunnel semantics for code navigation, because Public already has stronger authorities for semantic and structural code retrieval.
- MemPalace-style blocking save hooks as the primary preservation mechanism, because they conflict with Public’s structured save contract.
- Treating benchmark claims about rooms or AAAK as compatibility evidence, because the repo itself narrows or corrects those claims.

## Reflection
- **What worked**: Comparing the same concern across paired files, external source on one side and Public runtime files on the other, made compatibility boundaries much clearer than repo-level summaries.
- **What did not work**: CocoIndex MCP search cancelled again in this session, so this iteration had to rely on direct reads and grep-based source tracing.
- **What I would do differently**: The next write-enabled pass should turn this into an explicit authority matrix: which surface owns bootstrap, which owns save, which owns structural lookup, and which sidecars are allowed.

## Recommended Next Focus
Define the implementation authority contract for the three surviving ideas: bootstrap protocol hints, bounded verbatim evidence retention, and a temporal-fact sidecar, with explicit “must not compete with `code_graph_query`, CocoIndex, or JSON-primary `generate-context.js`” rules.
