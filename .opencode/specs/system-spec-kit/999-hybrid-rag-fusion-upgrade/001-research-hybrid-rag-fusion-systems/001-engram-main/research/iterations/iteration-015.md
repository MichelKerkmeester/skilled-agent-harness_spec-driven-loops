### Finding 2: Engram deliberately keeps prompt memory separate from its main retrieval lane

- **What it does**: Engram stores prompt records in searchable form (`SearchPrompts()` exists) but does not mix them into `mem_search`, which only hits observation records. Prompts instead feed `mem_context` as continuity scaffolding. So prompt memory is a parallel substrate for intent reconstruction, not a blind merge into the main relevance-ranked memory corpus.
- **Why it matters for us**: If Public adopts prompt memory, it should not dump prompts into `memory_search` and destabilize hybrid ranking. The better fit is additive continuity: use prompt records to enrich `session_resume`, `session_bootstrap`, or resume-mode `memory_context`, while keeping `memory_search` focused on curated memory artifacts. That preserves Public’s stronger semantic, causal, and graph-aware retrieval stack.
- **Recommendation**: adopt now
- **Impact**: high

### Finding 3: The pattern is worth borrowing, but Engram’s project-scoped trust model is not
- **Source**: [external/internal/mcp/mcp.go:857](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/001-engram-main/external/internal/mcp/mcp.go:857), [external/internal/mcp/mcp.go:515](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/001-engram-main/external/internal/mcp/mcp.go:515), [external/internal/store/store.go:754](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/001-engram-main/external/internal/store/store.go:754), [external/internal/store/store.go:2459](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/001-engram-main/external/internal/store/store.go:2459), [session-manager.ts:385](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/lib/session/session-manager.ts:385), [memory-context.ts:821](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/handlers/memory-context.ts:821), [session-manager.ts:1079](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/lib/session/session-manager.ts:1079)
- **What it does**: Engram’s prompt/session flow relies on normalized project names, explicit session start/end tools, and project consolidation when names drift. That is operationally clean, but trust is still mostly “session id + project name + normalization hygiene.” Public’s equivalent path is stricter: `resolveTrustedSession()` rejects caller-supplied sessions that are not server-managed and identity-correlated, and completed sessions clear working memory immediately.
- **Why it matters for us**: The prompt-memory idea ports well; the trust model does not. If Public adds a first-class prompt lane, it should bind prompts to trusted server sessions and governed tenant/user/agent/shared-space scope, not to project names as the primary isolation primitive. Otherwise we would weaken a system that is already stronger than Engram on multi-actor safety.
- **Recommendation**: reject
- **Impact**: high

## Assessment
- New information ratio: 0.62
- Questions addressed: Q1, Q2, Q5, Q7, Q8, Q9, Q10
- Questions answered: Q2, Q5, Q8, Q9, Q10

## Reflection
- What worked: tracing the pattern from `mem_save_prompt` registration into `handleSavePrompt()`, then through `user_prompts`/`prompts_fts`/sync/export/import and finally `FormatContext()` exposed that this is a full architectural lane, not a single tool; comparing that directly to Public’s `memory_context` resume injection and trusted-session lifecycle made the fit boundary very clear.
- What did not work: CocoIndex did not produce a usable pass on this Go-focused slice in this run, so I fell back to `rg` plus line-anchored reads; the strict validator again returned `PASSED` while also emitting `cannot create temp file for here document: Operation not permitted`, and this sandbox snapshot lacks the expected Level 3 phase docs at the phase root, so I kept the iteration read-only instead of attempting packet repair.

## Recommended Next Focus
Trace phase 003 and 004 specifically for whether they offer a better retrieval or ranking model for durable prompt/intent records, then design a Public-side prompt-memory sidecar that is resume-only by default, governed by trusted session scope, and explicitly separate from live `memory_search` ranking.

RESEARCH BRIEF:
# $refine TIDD-EC Prompt: 001-engram-main

## 2. Role

You are a research specialist in persistent memory architectures for AI agents, MCP server design, SQLite/FTS5 search systems, and agent-agnostic tool surfaces. Work like a systems analyst who can trace Go implementation details, separate durable patterns from packaging noise, and turn Engram's design into concrete improvements for `Code_Environment/Public`. Keep the analysis grounded in actual repository evidence, especially around tool profiles, session lifecycle, topic-key stability, passive capture, and search behavior.

## 3. Task

Research Engram's persistent memory architecture, MCP tool design, and session lifecycle patterns to identify practical improvements for `Code_Environment/Public`, especially for Spec Kit Memory. Focus on how Engram separates agent tools from admin tools, persists session history, stabilizes evolving topics with `topic_key`, and ranks or shortcuts search using SQLite + FTS5. Compare Engram's choices against current Public capabilities and classify each recommendation as `adopt now`, `prototype later`, or `reject`. Prioritize improvements that strengthen session continuity, memory hygiene, search usefulness, and agent-agnostic integration without duplicating systems Public already has.

## 4. Context

### System Description

Engram is a single Go binary that exposes one persistent memory backend through four surfaces: CLI, HTTP API, MCP stdio, and an interactive TUI. The storage layer lives in SQLite with FTS5 virtual tables for observations and prompts, while the MCP layer in `internal/mcp/mcp.go` registers tools with explicit profile separation and usage guidance. The value proposition is operational simplicity: one binary, one local database, zero external runtime dependency, and compatibility across Claude Code, OpenCode, Gemini CLI, Codex, VS Code Copilot, Cursor, Windsurf, and other MCP-capable agents.

The core memory model is project-scoped and session-aware. `internal/store/store.go` persists sessions, observations, and user prompts separately; `CreateSession()` and `EndSession()` maintain session boundaries, while `FormatContext()` composes recent sessions, prompts, and observations into startup context. Session summaries are treated as first-class memory artifacts rather than free-form chat residue, and passive capture exists as a distinct pathway for extracting learnings from output text.

Engram also has a strong opinion on memory hygiene. `AddObservation()` supports `topic_key` upserts so evolving topics revise a stable record instead of generating fragment spam, while exact-duplicate detection increments `duplicate_count` inside a rolling window. `SuggestTopicKey()` assigns family prefixes such as `architecture/`, `bug/`, `decision/`, and `session/`, and `Search()` first checks direct topic-key matches before FTS5 `MATCH`, then orders full-text results by `fts.rank` after `sanitizeFTS()` quotes individual terms. This phase should treat those behaviors as the domain center of gravity, not the TUI.

### Cross-Phase Awareness Table

| Phase | System | Core Pattern | Overlap Risk | Differentiation |
|-------|--------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|
| 001 | Engram | MCP memory server (Go, SQLite+FTS5) | 003 (MCP memory), 004 (hybrid search) | Focus tool profiles, session lifecycle, topic keys |
| 002 | Mex | Markdown scaffold + drift detection | 001 (memory persistence) | Focus drift detection, scaffold structure, no-DB approach |
| 003 | Modus Memory | FSRS spaced repetition + BM25 | 001 (FTS5 search), 004 (local memory) | Focus FSRS decay, cross-referencing, librarian expansion |
| 004 | OpenCode Mnemosyne | Hybrid search (FTS5 + vector) | 001 (FTS5), 003 (local memory) | Focus vector search, OpenCode plugin architecture, scoping |

### What This Repo Already Has

`Code_Environment/Public` already has Spec Kit Memory with semantic retrieval via `memory_search`, session continuity via `memory_context`, trigger-based recall via `memory_match_triggers`, causal links, health/status tooling, and context save flows through `generate-context.js`. It also has CocoIndex for semantic code search and code-graph tooling for structural queries. What it does **not** currently have is a first-class session lifecycle API comparable to `mem_session_start` / `mem_session_end`, nor a lightweight MCP tool-profile split equivalent to Engram's `ProfileAgent` versus `ProfileAdmin`.

## 5. Instructions

1. Treat `/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/001-engram-main` as the pre-approved phase folder. Skip Gate 3, keep all writes inside this phase folder, and treat everything under `external/` as read-only.
2. Read the governing `AGENTS.md` files first: the Public repo root `AGENTS.md` and `external/engram-main/AGENTS.md`. If the external repo references project-local skills, note them as evidence about contributor workflow rather than as primary architecture.
3. Before deep research begins, ensure this phase folder contains Level 3 Spec Kit docs: `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`, `checklist.md`, and `decision-record.md`.
4. Use `@speckit` for markdown authoring when the runtime supports agent routing. If routing is unavailable, preserve existing Spec Kit Level 3 structure manually without creating side-channel docs outside the phase folder.
5. Validate the phase folder with this exact command before the main research pass:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public && bash .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/spec/validate.sh "/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/001-engram-main" --strict
   ```
6. If validation fails, fix the docs in this same phase folder first. If blocked, record the blocker explicitly in `tasks.md` and `checklist.md` before continuing.
7. Run `spec_kit:deep-research` with this exact topic:
   ```text
   Research the external repository at /Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/001-engram-main/external/engram-main and identify concrete improvements for Code_Environment/Public, especially around persistent memory architecture, MCP tool design, session lifecycle, search ranking, and agent-agnostic integration patterns.
   ```
8. Follow this reading order for domain evidence: `internal/mcp/` first, especially `internal/mcp/mcp.go`; then `internal/store/`, especially `store.go`; then `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`; then `README.md`; then CLI/TUI or plugin docs only as supporting context.
9. Trace MCP tool registration end to end in `internal/mcp/mcp.go`: profile maps, `ResolveTools()`, `shouldRegister()`, eager versus deferred tools, tool descriptions, and handler wiring for `mem_search`, `mem_save`, `mem_context`, `mem_session_summary`, `mem_session_start`, `mem_session_end`, `mem_suggest_topic_key`, and `mem_capture_passive`.
10. Trace store behavior in `internal/store/store.go`: schema creation, FTS5 tables, `CreateSession()`, `EndSession()`, `AddObservation()`, `Search()`, `FormatContext()`, `SuggestTopicKey()`, and `sanitizeFTS()`. Pay attention to `revision_count`, `duplicate_count`, `deleted_at`, direct topic-key lookup, and soft-delete behavior.
11. Use CocoIndex plus grep to trace implementations and references. If CocoIndex is weak on Go files or times out, fall back to targeted grep plus direct file reads and state that fallback explicitly in the research notes.
12. Compare Engram directly against Public's current memory stack: Spec Kit Memory, `memory_context`, `memory_search`, `memory_match_triggers`, `generate-context.js`, CocoIndex, and any relevant code-graph/session-recovery surfaces. Keep the comparison concrete rather than generic.
13. Save all research outputs inside `research/`, with `research/research.md` as the canonical report. Every meaningful finding must cite exact Engram file paths and map the insight to a concrete Public gap, subsystem, or design question.
14. When research is complete, update `checklist.md`, create `implementation-summary.md`, and make sure the report explicitly distinguishes `adopt now`, `prototype later`, and `reject`.
15. Save memory for this phase folder with:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public && node .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/dist/memory/generate-context.js "/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/001-engram-main"
   ```

## 6. Research Questions

1. How effective is Engram's `ProfileAgent` versus `ProfileAdmin` split, and would a similar separation reduce tool clutter or accidental misuse in Public's memory surfaces?
2. What does Engram gain from explicit session lifecycle tools such as `mem_session_start`, `mem_session_end`, and `mem_session_summary`, and where would that improve Public beyond today's session continuity model?
3. How does `SuggestTopicKey()` create stable topic families, and could Public benefit from comparable topic-key or thread-key conventions for evolving decisions and repeated refinements?
4. How does `AddObservation()` balance topic upserts, duplicate suppression, and revision tracking, and what memory-hygiene lessons apply to Spec Kit Memory?
5. What are the practical consequences of Engram's FTS5 ranking approach, including direct topic-key shortcuts, `sanitizeFTS()`, and `fts.rank`, compared with Public's broader hybrid retrieval stack?
6. How does passive capture work conceptually and structurally, and could Public adopt a lightweight passive-learning path without duplicating manual memory-save flows?
7. How does MCP stdio transport plus a single binary distribution shape agent-agnostic adoption, plugin setup, and operational simplicity?
8. How does Engram handle multi-agent use safely through project scoping, normalized project names, and merge/consolidation tools, and what isolation lessons matter for Public?
9. Which Engram features are foundational memory-system ideas versus packaging or UX conveniences that Public should not over-copy?
10. Which patterns best improve compaction survival and startup continuity for future Public sessions, especially around summaries, prompts, and recent-context formatting?

## 7. Do's

- Do trace MCP tool registration end to end in `internal/mcp/mcp.go`, not just the README tool list.
- Do examine the SQLite schema and FTS5 tables in `internal/store/store.go`, including `observations_fts` and `prompts_fts`.
- Do study the `ProfileAgent` and `ProfileAdmin` separation as a product decision, not just a code convenience.
- Do inspect how sessions are opened, ended, summarized, and reformatted into startup context.
- Do analyze topic-key suggestion and upsert behavior for long-lived architectural or decision threads.
- Do verify where direct topic-key lookup outranks or bypasses normal FTS5 ranking.
- Do map every strong finding to a specific improvement area inside Spec Kit Memory or adjacent Public tooling.

## 8. Don'ts

- Do not spend most of the analysis on the TUI; it is a delivery surface, not the core memory pattern.
- Do not conflate Engram's MCP tools with Spec Kit Memory's MCP tools; they address overlapping goals through different architectures.
- Do not ignore plugin marketplace or agent setup integration; it matters as evidence of agent-agnostic distribution strategy.
- Do not try to run the Go binary in this phase; static analysis of source and docs is sufficient.
- Do not reduce Engram to "just FTS5"; the interesting part is how FTS5 is wrapped with session state, topic keys, and tool ergonomics.
- Do not over-recommend Engram features that Public already covers better via hybrid search, graph context, or semantic retrieval.
- Do not edit anything under `external/` or outside this phase folder.

## 9. Examples

### Example A: Tool-profile finding

```text
**Finding: Agent-safe MCP profile separation**
- Source: external/engram-main/internal/mcp/mcp.go
- What it does: `ProfileAgent` keeps proactive save/search/context/session tools available to agents, while `ProfileAdmin` isolates deletion, stats, timeline, and project-merge operations for curation workflows.
- Why it matters: Public currently exposes many memory capabilities without a comparable profile layer, so a narrower agent-safe surface could reduce prompt noise and misuse risk.
- Recommended action: prototype later
- Affected area: Spec Kit Memory tool surfacing, startup guidance, future profile-aware wrappers
- Risk/cost: Medium; requires deciding whether profile logic belongs in MCP schema, runtime config, or command wrappers
```

### Example B: Session and topic-key finding

```text
**Finding: Stable topic threads plus explicit session closure**
- Source: external/engram-main/internal/store/store.go; external/engram-main/internal/mcp/mcp.go; external/engram-main/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md
- What it does: `AddObservation()` upserts by `topic_key` within project+scope, increments `revision_count`, and pairs that with `mem_session_summary` / `mem_session_end` so evolving work stays threadable across sessions.
- Why it matters: Public has strong retrieval, but it does not yet expose a similarly lightweight thread-key plus explicit lifecycle model for durable session narratives.
- Recommended action: adopt now or prototype later, depending on implementation scope
- Affected area: session continuity design, save workflows, memory hygiene
- Risk/cost: Medium; thread-key collisions and scope semantics must be designed carefully
```

## 10. Constraints

### Error Handling

- If CocoIndex does not index the Go repo well enough, use grep plus direct file reads and state the fallback explicitly.
- If a README or architecture claim is not confirmed in `internal/mcp/` or `internal/store/`, mark it as unverified rather than proven.
- If file paths differ from the prompt assumptions, document the actual path and continue with source-backed analysis.
- If a design appears ambiguous, prefer citing the exact code path over prose documentation.

### Scope

**IN SCOPE**

- persistent memory architecture
- MCP tool design and registration
- session lifecycle management
- topic-key suggestion and upsert stability
- SQLite + FTS5 search behavior
- passive capture
- project scoping and agent-agnostic integration

**OUT OF SCOPE**

- TUI UX details beyond what they reveal about memory semantics
- HTTP API details unless they clarify the same core memory pattern
- Homebrew packaging or release automation
- generic Go style commentary
- speculative feature ideas unsupported by Engram evidence

### Prioritization Framework

Rank findings in this order: session-lifecycle leverage, memory-hygiene impact, topic-key stability value, tool-surface clarity, fit with existing Spec Kit Memory capabilities, search-quality implications, and ease of integrating the idea without duplicating Public's stronger semantic or graph-aware systems.

## 11. Deliverables

- `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`, `checklist.md`, and `decision-record.md` present and valid before deep research starts
- `research/research.md` as the canonical report with at least 5 evidence-backed findings
- each finding includes source path, what Engram does, why it matters for Public, recommendation, affected area, and risk/cost
- explicit comparison against current Public memory capabilities, especially Spec Kit Memory and CocoIndex
- `implementation-summary.md` created at the end
- memory saved from this exact phase folder using `generate-context.js`

## 12. Evaluation Criteria

- At least 5 findings are evidence-backed rather than speculative.
- Every nontrivial finding cites an exact Engram file path.
- Findings clearly distinguish Engram's strengths in tool profiles, session lifecycle, topic keys, or search behavior.
- Recommendations explicitly say `adopt now`, `prototype later`, or `reject`.
- Cross-phase overlap with 003 and 004 is acknowledged so the analysis does not duplicate BM25/FSRS or hybrid-vector ownership.
- The prompt remains RICCE-complete: role, instructions, context, constraints, and examples are all materially useful.
- The finished prompt is CLEAR-aligned and strong enough to target `>= 40/50`.

## 13. Completion Bar

- `phase-research-prompt.md` exists in this phase folder and is specific to Engram rather than generic memory-system research.
- The prompt includes all 13 required sections and stays domain-specific.
- Instructions contain the exact deep-research topic string and exact validation command.
- The prompt clearly directs research toward tool profiles, session lifecycle, topic keys, passive capture, and FTS5 behavior.
- Deliverables require at least 5 evidence-backed findings with exact citations.
- The final content is RICCE compliant and intended to score CLEAR `>= 40/50`.
- No edits are made outside this phase folder.

I’m treating this as a read-only deep-research pass on iteration 015: trace the second pattern through Engram’s actual source, compare it directly to Public’s memory stack, and keep the analysis evidence-first. I’ll start by loading the governing repo instructions, doing a quick memory pass for prior context, then I’ll validate the phase folder and trace the implementation paths in `internal/mcp` and `internal/store` before synthesizing findings.

## 1. 🚨 CRITICAL RULES

**HARD BLOCKERS (The "Four Laws" of Agent Safety):**
1. **READ FIRST:** Never edit a file without reading it first. Understand context before modifying.
2. **SCOPE LOCK:** Only modify files explicitly in scope. **NO** "cleaning up" or "improving" adjacent code. Scope in `spec.md` is FROZEN.
3. **VERIFY:** Syntax checks and tests **MUST** pass before claiming completion. **NO** blind commits.
4. **HALT:** Stop immediately if uncertain, if line numbers don't match, or if tests fail. (See "Halt Conditions" below).

**OPERATIONAL MANDATES:**
- **All file modifications require a spec folder** (Gate 3).
- **Never lie or fabricate** - use "UNKNOWN" when uncertain.
- **Clarify** if confidence < 80% (see §5 Confidence Framework).
- **Use explicit uncertainty:** Prefix claims with "I'M UNCERTAIN ABOUT THIS:".

**QUALITY PRINCIPLES:**
- **Prefer simplicity**, reuse existing patterns, and cite evidence with sources
- Solve only the stated problem; **avoid over-engineering** and premature optimization
- **Verify with checks** (simplicity, performance, maintainability, scope) before making changes
- **Truth over agreement** - correct user misconceptions with evidence; do not agree for conversational flow

**HALT CONDITIONS (Stop and Report):**
- [ ] Target file does not exist or line numbers don't match.
- [ ] Syntax check or Tests fail after edit.
- [ ] Merge conflicts encountered.
- [ ] Edit tool reports "string not found".
- [ ] Test/Production boundary is unclear.

**MANDATORY TOOLS:**
- **Spec Kit Memory MCP** for research tasks, context recovery, and finding prior work.  **Memory saves MUST use `node .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/dist/memory/generate-context.js`** — NEVER manually create memory files.
  - AI composes structured JSON → `generate-context.js --json '{"specFolder":"...","sessionSummary":"..."}' [spec-folder]` or writes to `/tmp/save-context-data.json` and passes as first arg.
- **Code Search Decision Tree** (MANDATORY):
  - Semantic/concept search → `mcp__cocoindex_code__search` (CocoIndex). Skill: `.opencode/skill/mcp-coco-index/`
  - Structural queries (callers, imports, deps) → `code_graph_query` (Code Graph)
  - Exact text/regex → `Grep`

**GIT WORKFLOW:** 
Full details: `.opencode/skill/sk-git/`
- Worktree setup, conventional commits, PR creation, branch management
- Trigger keywords: worktree, branch, commit, merge, pr, pull request, git workflow, finish work, integrate changes

### Quick Reference: Common Workflows

| Task                      | Flow                                                                                                                               |

## Context Recovery

These recovery steps are universal across Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex CLI, Copilot CLI, and Gemini CLI.

### After Context Compaction Or `/clear`

1. **FIRST ACTION** — call `memory_context({ input: "resume previous work", mode: "resume", profile: "resume" })`
2. Review the recovered state: current task, spec folder, blockers, and next steps
3. Re-read the active runtime-specific instructions if they exist (`CODEX.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `.claude/CLAUDE.md`, runtime agent docs)
4. Present a concise recovered summary and WAIT for confirmation before proceeding

### Coding Analysis Lenses 

| Lens               | Focus            | Detection Questions                                                                |
| ------------------ | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **CLARITY**        | Simplicity       | Is this the simplest code that solves the problem? Are abstractions earned?        |
| **SYSTEMS**        | Dependencies     | What does this change touch? What calls this? What are the side effects?           |
| **BIAS**           | Wrong problem    | Is user solving a symptom? Is this premature optimization? Is the framing correct? |
| **SUSTAINABILITY** | Maintainability  | Will future devs understand this? Is it self-documenting? Tech debt implications?  |
| **VALUE**          | Actual impact    | Does this change behavior or just refactor? Is it cosmetic or functional?          |
| **SCOPE**          | Complexity match | Does solution complexity match problem size? Single-line fix or new abstraction?   |

### Coding Anti-Patterns (Detect Silently)

| Anti-Pattern           | Trigger Phrases                                 | Response                                                                    |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Over-engineering       | "for flexibility", "future-proof", "might need" | Ask: "Is this solving a current problem or a hypothetical one?"             |
| Premature optimization | "could be slow", "might bottleneck"             | Ask: "Has this been measured? What's the actual performance?"               |
| Cargo culting          | "best practice", "always should"                | Ask: "Does this pattern fit this specific case?"                            |
| Gold-plating           | "while we're here", "might as well"             | Flag scope creep: "That's a separate change - shall I note it for later?"   |
| Wrong abstraction      | "DRY this up" for 2 instances                   | "These look similar but might not be the same concept. Let's verify first." |
| Scope creep            | "also add", "bonus feature"                     | "That's outside the current scope. Want to track it separately?"            |

## 2. ⛔ MANDATORY GATES - STOP BEFORE ACTING

**⚠️ BEFORE using ANY tool (except Gate Actions: memory_match_triggers, skill_advisor.py), you MUST pass all applicable gates below.**

### 🔒 PRE-EXECUTION GATES (Pass before ANY tool use)

#### GATE 1: UNDERSTANDING + CONTEXT SURFACING [SOFT] BLOCK
Trigger: EACH new user message (re-evaluate even in ongoing conversations)
1. Call `memory_match_triggers(prompt)` → Surface relevant context
2. Classify intent: Research or Implementation
3. Parse request → Check confidence AND uncertainty (see §4)
4. **Dual-threshold:** confidence ≥ 0.70 AND uncertainty ≤ 0.35 → PROCEED. Either fails → INVESTIGATE (max 3 iterations) → ESCALATE. Simple: <40% ASK | 40-69% CAUTION | ≥70% PASS

> Gate 1 is SOFT — if file modification detected, Gate 3 (HARD) takes precedence. Ask spec folder question BEFORE analysis.

####  GATE 2: SKILL ROUTING [REQUIRED for non-trivial tasks]
1. A) Run: `python3 .opencode/skill/scripts/skill_advisor.py "[request]" --threshold 0.8`
2. B) Cite user's explicit direction: "User specified: [exact quote]"
- Confidence ≥ 0.8 → MUST invoke skill | < 0.8 → general approach | User names skill → cite and proceed
- Output: `SKILL ROUTING: [result]` or `SKILL ROUTING: User directed → [name]`
- Skip: trivial queries only (greetings, single-line questions)

#### GATE 3: SPEC FOLDER QUESTION [HARD] BLOCK — PRIORITY GATE
- **Overrides Gates 1-2:** If file modification detected → ask Gate 3 BEFORE any analysis/tool calls
- **Triggers:** rename, move, delete, create, add, remove, update, change, modify, edit, fix, refactor, implement, build, write, generate, configure, analyze, decompose, phase — or any task resulting in file changes
- **Options:** A) Existing | B) New | C) Update related | D) Skip | E) Phase folder (e.g., `specs/NNN-name/001-phase/`)
- **DO NOT** use Read/Edit/Write/Bash (except Gate Actions) before asking. ASK FIRST, wait for response, THEN proceed
- **Phase boundary:** Gate 3 answers apply ONLY within current workflow phase. Plan→implement transition MUST re-evaluate. Exception: carry-over IS valid for Memory Save Rule

#### CONSOLIDATED QUESTION PROTOCOL
When multiple inputs are needed, consolidate into a SINGLE prompt — never split across messages. Include only applicable questions; omit when pre-determined.
- **Round-trip optimization** — Only 1 user interaction needed for setup
- **First Message Protocol** — ALL questions asked BEFORE any analysis or tool calls
- **Violation:** Multiple separate prompts → STOP, apologize, re-present as single prompt
- **Bypass phrases:** "skip context" / "fresh start" / "skip memory" / [skip] for memory loading; Level 1 tasks skip completion verification

---

### 🔒 POST-EXECUTION RULES

#### MEMORY SAVE RULE [HARD] BLOCK
Trigger: "save context", "save memory", `/memory:save`, memory file creation
- If spec folder established at Gate 3 → USE IT (don't re-ask). Carry-over applies ONLY to memory saves
- If NO folder and Gate 3 never answered → HARD BLOCK → Ask user
- **Script:** `node .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/dist/memory/generate-context.js`
  - AI composes structured JSON with session context, writes to `/tmp/save-context-data.json`, passes as first arg. Alternatively use `--json '<inline-json>'` or `--stdin`. The AI has strictly better information about its own session than any DB extraction.
  - Subfolder: `003-parent/121-child` or bare `121-child` (auto-searches parents)
- **Indexing:** For immediate MCP visibility after save: `memory_index_scan({ specFolder })` or `memory_save()`
- **Violation:** Write tool on `memory/` path → DELETE and re-run via script
- **Post-Save Review:** After `generate-context.js` completes, check the POST-SAVE QUALITY REVIEW output.
  - **HIGH** issues: MUST manually patch via Edit tool (fix title, trigger_phrases, importance_tier)
  - **MEDIUM** issues: patch when practical
  - **PASSED/SKIPPED**: no action needed

#### COMPLETION VERIFICATION RULE [HARD] BLOCK
Trigger: Claiming "done", "complete", "finished", "works"
1. Validation runs automatically on spec folder (if exists)
2. Load `checklist.md` → Verify ALL items → Mark `[x]` with evidence
- Skip: Level 1 tasks (no checklist.md required) | Exit 0 = pass, Exit 1 = warnings, Exit 2 = errors (must fix)

#### VIOLATION RECOVERY [SELF-CORRECTION]
Trigger: About to skip gates, or realized gates were skipped → STOP → STATE: "Before I proceed, I need to ask about documentation:" → ASK Gate 3 (A/B/C/D/E) → WAIT

#### Self-Check (before ANY tool-using response):
- [ ] File modification? Asked spec folder question?
- [ ] Skill routing verified?
- [ ] Saving memory? Using `generate-context.js` (not Write tool)?
- [ ] Aligned with ORIGINAL request? No scope drift?
- [ ] Claiming completion? `checklist.md` verified?

## 3. 📝 CONVERSATION DOCUMENTATION

Every conversation that modifies files MUST have a spec folder. **Full details:** system-spec-kit SKILL.md (§1 When to Use, §3 How it Works, §4 Rules)

### Documentation Levels

| Level  | LOC            | Required Files                                        | Use When                           |
| ------ | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **1**  | <100           | spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md, implementation-summary.md | All features (minimum)             |
| **2**  | 100-499        | Level 1 + checklist.md                                | QA validation needed               |
| **3**  | ≥500           | Level 2 + decision-record.md (+ optional research.md) | Complex/architecture changes       |
| **3+** | Complexity 80+ | Level 3 + AI protocols, extended checklist, sign-offs | Multi-agent, enterprise governance |

> **Note:** `implementation-summary.md` is REQUIRED for all levels but created **after implementation completes**, not at spec folder creation time. See SKILL.md §4 Rule 13.

**Rules:** When in doubt → higher level. LOC is soft guidance (risk/complexity can override). Single typo/whitespace fixes (<5 characters in one file) are exempt.

**Spec folder path:** `specs/[###-short-name]/` | **Templates:** `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/templates/`

**For details on:** folder structure, `scratch/` vs `memory/` usage, sub-folder versioning, checklist verification (P0/P1/P2), and completion workflow — see system-spec-kit SKILL.md §3.

---

## 4. 🧑‍🏫 CONFIDENCE & CLARIFICATION FRAMEWORK

**Core Principle:** If confidence < 80%, pause and ask for clarification with multiple-choice options.

| Confidence   | Action                                       |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| **≥80%**     | Proceed with citable source                  |
| **40-79%**   | Proceed with caveats                         |
| **<40%**     | Ask for clarification or mark "UNKNOWN"      |
| **Override** | Blockers/conflicts → ask regardless of score |

**Logic-Sync Protocol:** On contradiction (Spec vs Code, conflicting requirements) → HALT → Report "LOGIC-SYNC REQUIRED: [Fact A] contradicts [Fact B]" → Ask "Which truth prevails?"

**Escalation:** Confidence stays <80% after two failed attempts → ask with 2-3 options. Blockers beyond control → escalate with evidence and proposed next step.

# Autonomous Deep Research Loop

Iterative research protocol with fresh context per iteration, externalized state, and convergence detection for deep technical investigation.

Runtime path resolution:
- OpenCode/Copilot runtime: `.opencode/agent/*.md`
- Claude runtime: `.claude/agents/*.md`
- Codex runtime: `.codex/agents/*.toml`

<!-- ANCHOR:when-to-use -->
## 1. WHEN TO USE

### When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Deep investigation requiring multiple rounds of discovery
- Topic spans 3+ technical domains or sources
- Initial findings need progressive refinement
- Overnight or unattended research sessions
- Research where prior findings inform subsequent queries

### When NOT to Use

- Simple, single-question research (use direct codebase search or `/spec_kit:plan`)
- Known-solution documentation (use `/spec_kit:plan`)
- Implementation tasks (use `/spec_kit:implement`)
- Quick codebase searches (use `@context` or direct Grep/Glob)
- Fewer than 3 sources needed (single-pass research suffices)

### Keyword Triggers

`autoresearch`, `deep research`, `autonomous research`, `research loop`, `iterative research`, `multi-round research`, `deep investigation`, `comprehensive research`

For iterative code review and quality auditing, see `sk-deep-review`.

### Lifecycle Contract

Live lifecycle branches:
- `resume` — continue the active lineage
- `restart` — start a new generation with explicit parent linkage
- `fork` — branch from the current packet state
- `completed-continue` — reopen a completed lineage only after immutable synthesis snapshotting

## 2. SMART ROUTING

### Resource Loading Levels

| Level | When to Load | Resources |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| ALWAYS | Every skill invocation | Quick reference baseline |
| CONDITIONAL | If intent signals match | Loop protocol, convergence, state format |
| ON_DEMAND | Only on explicit request | Templates, detailed specifications |

### Scoped Guard

```python
def _guard_in_skill():
    """Verify this skill is active before loading resources."""
    if not hasattr(_guard_in_skill, '_active'):
        _guard_in_skill._active = True
    return _guard_in_skill._active

def discover_markdown_resources(base_path: Path) -> list[str]:
    """Discover all .md files in the assets directory."""
    return sorted(str(p.relative_to(base_path)) for p in (base_path / "references").glob("*.md"))
```

### Phase Detection

Detect the current research phase from dispatch context to load appropriate resources:

| Phase | Signal | Resources to Load |
|-------|--------|-------------------|
| Init | No JSONL exists | Loop protocol, state format |
| Iteration | Dispatch context includes iteration number | Loop protocol, convergence |
| Stuck | Dispatch context includes "RECOVERY" | Convergence, loop protocol |
| Synthesis | Convergence triggered STOP | Quick reference |

### Core Innovation: Fresh Context Per Iteration

Each agent dispatch gets a fresh context window. State continuity comes from files, not memory. This solves context degradation in long research sessions.

Adapted from: karpathy/autoresearch (loop concept), AGR (fresh context "Ralph Loop"), pi-autoresearch (JSONL state), autoresearch-opencode (context injection).

### Data Flow

```
Init --> Create config.json, strategy.md, state.jsonl
  |
Loop --> Read state --> Check convergence --> Dispatch @deep-research
  |                                              |
  |                                              v
  |                                         Agent executes:
  |                                         1. Read state files
  |                                         2. Determine focus
  |                                         3. Research (3-5 actions)
  |                                         4. Write iteration-NNN.md
  |                                         5. Update strategy.md
  |                                         6. Append state.jsonl
  |                                              |
  +<--- Evaluate results <-----------------------+
  |
  +--- Continue? --> Yes: next iteration
  |                  No: exit loop
  v
Synthesize --> Compile final research/research.md
  |
Save --> generate-context.js --> verify memory artifact
```

### Key Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Externalized state** | All research continuity via files, not agent memory |
| **Fresh context** | Each iteration gets a clean agent with no prior context |
| **Convergence** | Multi-signal detection: newInfoRatio, stuck count, questions answered |
| **Strategy file** | Reducer-synchronized research steering with machine-owned sections |
| **JSONL log** | Append-only structured log for lineage and iteration data |
| **Findings registry** | Reducer-owned open/resolved questions, key findings, and ruled-out directions |

379:- prompt authoring pattern for this packet family: keep the 13-section TIDD-EC structure, include ordered evidence reading, and force evidence tags (`source-confirmed`, `README-documented`, `benchmark-documented`) per finding [Task 1]
397:- symptom: strict validation step in prompt cannot run; cause: phase lacks Level 3 docs (`spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`, `checklist.md`, `decision-record.md`); fix: create/verify those docs before running `validate.sh --strict` or deep research loops [Task 1]

429:- when the user asked to “Add a prompt in each phase folder ... create level 3 speckit documentation ... utilize spec_kit:deep-research BUT need to create proper spec documentation in the folder first,” prompts should enforce: use the existing phase folder, author Level 3 docs first, then research that phase `external/` tree with evidence-backed outcomes and checklist/implementation-summary/memory updates [Task 1]
430:- when the user asked to “create a similar prompt ... in their root folders | skip spec folder,” place `phase-research-prompt.md` in each phase root and avoid spinning up new spec-folder scaffolding [Task 2]
434:- in this repo `specs/` is a symlink to `.opencode/specs`; phase prompt/spec work should be applied under `.opencode/specs/...` paths [Task 1]
435:- prompt artifact placement for this phase family is phase-root `phase-research-prompt.md` (not `scratch/`) and should reference that phase’s own `external/` tree [Task 1][Task 2]

954:- Codex command prompts are discovered via `~/.codex/prompts`; for this checkout the symlink must resolve to `/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.codex/prompts` (not the `.codex` root) [Task 1]
955:- Some builds/autocomplete paths still expect flat files like `spec_kit-plan.md` and `memory-save.md`; keep compatibility symlinks from `.codex/prompts/<group>-<command>.md` to `.opencode/command/<group>/<command>.md` [Task 1]
956:- If slash commands vanish, verify both `readlink ~/.codex/prompts` and presence of `spec_kit-*.md`/`memory-*.md` compatibility files before restarting Codex [Task 1]
960:- symptom: typing `/spec_kit` shows blank command list; cause: `~/.codex/prompts` linked to `/Users/.../.codex` instead of `/Users/.../.codex/prompts`; fix: repoint global symlink to the actual prompts subfolder and re-list prompt files [Task 1]

I’ve loaded the repo and external instructions, plus the deep-research skill baseline. Next I’m validating the phase folder and tracing the prompt-memory separation pattern through Engram’s MCP handlers, store layer, and Public’s resume/search handlers so we can compare architecture rather than docs.

CocoIndex didn’t give me a usable pass in this slice, so I’m falling back to targeted `rg` plus direct reads for the Go paths, exactly as the prompt allowed. I’m also waiting on the strict validator because this phase folder already looks suspiciously sparse at the root.

I’ve got the index map now: Engram clearly has a separate `SearchPrompts()` lane and `FormatContext()` composes prompts into startup context rather than `mem_search`. I’m drilling into the exact handlers and store queries next so the final write-up stays grounded in implementation, not interpretation.

The comparison boundary is sharp now: Engram’s prompt lane has its own schema, FTS table, and API, while `mem_search` still routes only to observations; Public’s equivalent continuity signal is working-memory-derived prompt context injected only during resume. I’m grabbing the remaining handler glue and a couple of support lines so I can state that cleanly and not over-claim.

One extra architectural wrinkle showed up: Engram’s prompt-search lane exists in the store and HTTP server, but not in the MCP surface I’ve traced so far. That strengthens the “parallel substrate for continuity” reading even more, and I’m pulling the route registration to confirm whether agents can reach it or only dashboards/admin surfaces can.

I’ve confirmed a couple of useful blockers too: this phase root is missing the Level 3 docs the prompt expects, and there’s no canonical `research/research.md` yet, even though iteration artifacts exist through 014.

# Iteration 015: DEEP DIVE - SECOND PATTERN

## Focus
DEEP DIVE - SECOND PATTERN: Go deep on the second most impactful pattern. Full implementation analysis.

## Findings
### Finding 1: Engram enforces prompt separation at the MCP handler boundary
- **Source**: [external/internal/mcp/mcp.go:350](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/001-engram-main/external/internal/mcp/mcp.go:350), [external/internal/mcp/mcp.go:375](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/001-engram-main/external/internal/mcp/mcp.go:375), [external/internal/mcp/mcp.go:625](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/001-engram-main/external/internal/mcp/mcp.go:625), [external/internal/mcp/mcp.go:851](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/001-engram-main/external/internal/mcp/mcp.go:851)
- **What it does**: `mem_save_prompt` is agent-visible and eagerly registered, but `mem_search` still delegates only to `s.Search(...)`, which searches observations, not prompts. Prompt retrieval for agents happens indirectly through `mem_context`, whose handler calls `FormatContext()`.
- **Why it matters for us**: This is stronger than “don’t rank prompts too highly.” It is hard architectural separation. Public can borrow the pattern safely by keeping prompt continuity outside `memory_search`.
- **Recommendation**: adopt now
- **Impact**: high

### Finding 2: The separation is backed by a full parallel storage lane, not a tag on the main corpus
- **Source**: [external/internal/store/store.go:487](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/001-engram-main/external/internal/store/store.go:487), [external/internal/store/store.go:501](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/001-engram-main/external/internal/store/store.go:501), [external/internal/store/store.go:1109](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/001-engram-main/external/internal/store/store.go:1109), [external/internal/store/store.go:1181](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/001-engram-main/external/internal/store/store.go:1181), [external/internal/store/store.go:1462](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/001-engram-main/external/internal/store/store.go:1462)
- **What it does**: Engram uses separate `user_prompts` and `prompts_fts` tables, separate insert logic with `prompt-*` sync IDs, and a separate `SearchPrompts()` query ordered by `fts.rank`. Meanwhile `Search()` stays observation-only and retains topic-key shortcuts plus observation FTS.
- **Why it matters for us**: If Public wants durable prompt memory, a real sidecar table or index is the right shape. Script-level `user_prompts` fields in saved artifacts are not equivalent to a live searchable runtime lane.
- **Recommendation**: prototype later
- **Impact**: high

### Finding 3: Engram exposes prompt retrieval to HTTP, but not to the agent MCP surface
- **Source**: [external/internal/server/server.go:120](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/001-engram-main/external/internal/server/server.go:120), [external/internal/server/server.go:122](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/001-engram-main/external/internal/server/server.go:122), [external/internal/server/server.go:411](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/001-engram-main/external/internal/server/server.go:411), [external/internal/mcp/mcp.go:53](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/001-engram-main/external/internal/mcp/mcp.go:53)
- **What it does**: The HTTP server has `/prompts/recent` and `/prompts/search`, but the MCP agent profile only exposes `mem_save_prompt` and `mem_context`; there is no MCP `mem_search_prompts` equivalent.
- **Why it matters for us**: Engram treats prompt memory as continuity infrastructure, not normal agent recall. That supports a Public design where prompt records enrich `session_resume`, `session_bootstrap`, or resume-mode `memory_context` first, without adding another broad search surface.
- **Recommendation**: adopt now
- **Impact**: high

### Finding 4: Engram’s prompt lane is useful, but its filtering semantics are weaker than Public should accept
- **Source**: [external/internal/store/store.go:1145](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/001-engram-main/external/internal/store/store.go:1145), [external/internal/store/store.go:1181](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/001-engram-main/external/internal/store/store.go:1181), [external/internal/store/store.go:1613](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/001-engram-main/external/internal/store/store.go:1613), [external/internal/server/server.go:418](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/001-engram-main/external/internal/server/server.go:418)
- **What it does**: `RecentPrompts()` only filters by project, `FormatContext()` feeds it only `project`, not `scope`, and the HTTP prompt-search path passes raw `project` through to `SearchPrompts()` without the normalization step that observation search gets.
- **Why it matters for us**: The separation idea is good; the isolation model is not. Public already has stronger tenant/user/agent/shared-space and trusted-session boundaries, so any durable prompt sidecar should inherit those, not downgrade to project-only continuity.
- **Recommendation**: reject
- **Impact**: medium

### Finding 5: Public already implements the principle, but only as transient resume-time scaffolding
- **Source**: [memory-context.ts:784](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/handlers/memory-context.ts:784), [memory-context.ts:1435](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/handlers/memory-context.ts:1435), [working-memory.ts:325](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/lib/cognitive/working-memory.ts:325), [session-manager.ts:385](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/lib/session/session-manager.ts:385), [session-manager.ts:1090](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/lib/session/session-manager.ts:1090), [memory-search.ts:482](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/handlers/memory-search.ts:482), [generate-context.js:97](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/dist/memory/generate-context.js:97), [handler-memory-context.vitest.ts:565](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/tests/handler-memory-context.vitest.ts:565)
- **What it does**: Public’s resume path runs `memory_search` with anchored content, then optionally injects `systemPromptContext` from high-attention working-memory items when the session is trusted and resumed. Tests verify that injection only in resume conditions. The save script accepts `user_prompts`, but live runtime retrieval does not yet persist or search them as first-class entities.
- **Why it matters for us**: Public has the right behavioral boundary already: prompt-like context is additive continuity, not ranking input. The missing piece is durability beyond working-memory lifetime, especially because completed sessions clear working memory immediately.
- **Recommendation**: prototype later
- **Impact**: high

## Assessment
- New information ratio: 0.58
- Questions addressed: Q1, Q2, Q5, Q7, Q8, Q9, Q10
- Questions answered: Q2, Q5, Q7, Q8, Q9, Q10

## Reflection
- What worked: tracing handler boundaries first, then store/schema, then server exposure made the pattern much clearer than reading docs alone; the most useful comparison was Engram’s `mem_search` versus Public’s resume-only `systemPromptContext` injection.
- What did not work: CocoIndex did not yield a usable pass on this Go slice in this run, so I fell back to `rg` plus direct reads; the strict validator returned `PASSED` but also emitted `cannot create temp file for here document: Operation not permitted`, and the phase root currently lacks the Level 3 files and canonical `research/research.md` that the prompt expects, so I kept this iteration read-only.

## Recommended Next Focus
Trace phases 003 and 004 for whether they provide a better retrieval model for a durable prompt sidecar, then design a Public implementation that keeps prompt records out of `memory_search`, injects them only into resume/bootstrap surfaces, and binds them to trusted governed session scope rather than project-only filtering.

## Reflection
- What worked: tracing handler boundaries first, then store/schema, then server exposure made the pattern much clearer than reading docs alone; the most useful comparison was Engram’s `mem_search` versus Public’s resume-only `systemPromptContext` injection.
- What did not work: CocoIndex did not yield a usable pass on this Go slice in this run, so I fell back to `rg` plus direct reads; the strict validator returned `PASSED` but also emitted `cannot create temp file for here document: Operation not permitted`, and the phase root currently lacks the Level 3 files and canonical `research/research.md` that the prompt expects, so I kept this iteration read-only.

## Recommended Next Focus
Trace phases 003 and 004 for whether they provide a better retrieval model for a durable prompt sidecar, then design a Public implementation that keeps prompt records out of `memory_search`, injects them only into resume/bootstrap surfaces, and binds them to trusted governed session scope rather than project-only filtering.
