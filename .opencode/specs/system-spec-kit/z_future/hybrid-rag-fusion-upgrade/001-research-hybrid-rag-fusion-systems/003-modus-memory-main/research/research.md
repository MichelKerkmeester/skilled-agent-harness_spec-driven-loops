# $refine TIDD-EC Prompt: 003-modus-memory-main

## 2. Role

You are a research specialist in spaced repetition memory systems, BM25 search ranking, cross-referenced knowledge graphs, MCP-exposed local memory services, and local-first personal memory architectures. Work like a systems analyst who can trace implementation details from source code, separate README claims from verified mechanics, and translate Modus Memory's specific design choices into concrete improvements for `Code_Environment/Public`.

## 3. Task

Research Modus Memory's FSRS spaced repetition, BM25 search ranking, and cross-referencing patterns to identify practical, evidence-backed improvements for `Code_Environment/Public`'s memory search and retrieval, especially around memory decay and reinforcement, query expansion, knowledge linking, and plain-markdown memory storage patterns. Determine which ideas should be `adopt now`, `prototype later`, or `reject`.

## 4. Context

### 4.1 System Description

Modus Memory is a local memory server that stores data as plain markdown files, exposes MCP tools, uses BM25 with field boosting, layers a tiered query cache over lexical retrieval, applies FSRS-style spaced repetition with decay and reinforcement, builds cross-references from subjects, tags, and entities, and uses a librarian query expander to widen lexical recall without relying on vectors. The core attraction is a lightweight local binary, markdown-native persistence, and search behavior that mixes ranking, recency, and linked context while staying git-friendly and human-readable.

### 4.2 Cross-Phase Awareness Table

| Phase | System | Core Pattern | Overlap Risk | Differentiation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 001 | Engram | MCP memory server (Go, SQLite+FTS5) | 003 (MCP memory) | Focus tool profiles, session lifecycle, topic keys |
| 002 | Mex | Markdown scaffold + drift detection | 003 (markdown storage) | Focus drift detection, scaffold structure |
| 003 | Modus Memory | FSRS spaced repetition + BM25 | 001 (FTS5), 004 (local memory) | Focus FSRS decay, cross-referencing, librarian expansion |
| 004 | OpenCode Mnemosyne | Hybrid search (FTS5 + vector) | 003 (local memory) | Focus vector search, plugin architecture |

### 4.3 What This Repo Already Has

`Code_Environment/Public` already has Spec Kit Memory with semantic and hybrid retrieval, markdown-backed memory artifacts, importance tiers, and an FSRS-based classification-decay layer in the MCP server. It does **not** currently mirror Modus Memory's end-to-end local vault server model, BM25 field-boosted lexical search with lightweight query caching, librarian-style synonym expansion for keyword retrieval, or simple subject/tag/entity adjacency maps that surface connected documents directly in result sets. Base the comparison on current code, not stale assumptions.

## 5. Instructions

1. Treat `/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/003-modus-memory-main` as the pre-approved phase folder. Skip Gate 3, keep all writes inside this phase folder, and treat everything under `external/` as read-only.
2. Start with the lexical search implementation: read `external/modus-memory-main/internal/index/bm25.go`, `external/modus-memory-main/internal/index/cache.go`, and `external/modus-memory-main/internal/librarian/search.go` before anything else. Trace tokenization, stemming, field weights, prefix matching, Jaccard cache reuse, and query expansion order.
3. After the ranking path, read `external/modus-memory-main/internal/index/indexer.go` if needed to confirm how documents are loaded into the search engine and how search results are assembled. Keep focus on ranking behavior, not generic indexing boilerplate.
4. Next, trace FSRS and memory-fact behavior by reading `external/modus-memory-main/internal/vault/facts.go` and `external/modus-memory-main/internal/index/facts.go`. Extract the exact stability, difficulty, confidence, floor, access-count, and reinforcement mechanics. Do not collapse these into a generic "TTL" description.
5. After FSRS, inspect cross-referencing by reading `external/modus-memory-main/internal/index/crossref.go`. Trace how subject, tag, and entity adjacency maps are built, what weighting is used for connected results, and what the system deliberately does **not** do because it avoids a full graph database.
6. Read `external/modus-memory-main/internal/markdown/parser.go` and `external/modus-memory-main/internal/markdown/writer.go` after the retrieval core. Study frontmatter parsing, body parsing, wiki-link extraction, markdown write conventions, and how plain-file storage shapes operability and portability.
7. Read MCP tool handlers next: `external/modus-memory-main/internal/mcp/vault.go` and `external/modus-memory-main/internal/mcp/memory.go`. Trace which tools are free vs. Pro, where librarian expansion is invoked, where cross-reference hints are appended, and where reinforcement happens automatically on search recall.
8. Read `/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/003-modus-memory-main/external/modus-memory-main/README.md` only after the source files above. Use it to validate claims about cached search speed, markdown-native persistence, binary size, MCP surface area, and the intended value proposition. Do not let README marketing copy override code evidence.
9. Compare Modus directly against current `Code_Environment/Public` memory behavior by reading `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/handlers/memory-search.ts`, `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/lib/search/fsrs.ts`, and `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/lib/cognitive/fsrs-scheduler.ts`. Be explicit about what this repo already does with FSRS-style decay and where Modus still differs materially.
10. Separate overlap cleanly across phases: avoid redoing `001` as a generic MCP memory-server study, avoid drifting into `002` markdown-scaffold and drift-detection patterns, and avoid reframing `003` as vector or plugin work owned by `004`. This phase owns BM25, lightweight caching, librarian expansion, FSRS reinforcement loops, and adjacency-map cross-references.
11. Before any deep-research run, ensure this phase folder contains the required Spec Kit docs for the research effort. If they are missing, note the gap and create or request them through the established spec workflow before claiming the phase is complete.
12. Validate the phase folder before deep research with:
    ```bash
    cd /Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public && bash .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/spec/validate.sh "/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/003-modus-memory-main" --strict
    ```
13. After validation passes, run deep research against this same phase folder using this exact topic:
    ```text
    Research the external repository at /Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/003-modus-memory-main/external/modus-memory-main and identify concrete improvements for Code_Environment/Public, especially around spaced repetition memory decay, BM25 search ranking, query expansion, cross-referencing, and plain-markdown memory storage patterns.
    ```
