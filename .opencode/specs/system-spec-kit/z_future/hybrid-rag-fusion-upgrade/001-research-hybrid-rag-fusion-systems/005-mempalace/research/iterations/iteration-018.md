### Finding 4: Full palace taxonomy is expensive to integrate and not differentiated enough

- **What it does**: MemPalace room assignment is mostly folder-name and keyword heuristics at ingest, plain Chroma metadata filters at retrieval, and a derived graph built from shared `wing`/`room` metadata. The README’s own correction note says the “+34% palace boost” is just metadata filtering, and the benchmark notes show room routing still trails the no-rooms hybrid baseline.
- **Why it matters for us**: Public would need new save-time taxonomy generation, label governance, reindex logic, and drift controls just to recreate a layer that is mostly packaging plus filters. Integration difficulty is **high**, and the unique upside is too small given Public already has spec-folder scoping, context types, tiers, and structural code graph tools.
- **Recommendation**: reject
- **Impact**: low

### Finding 5: A separate temporal fact graph is valuable, but only behind a stricter source contract than MemPalace uses
- **Source**: [knowledge_graph.py#L46](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/knowledge_graph.py#L46), [knowledge_graph.py#L121](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/knowledge_graph.py#L121), [knowledge_graph.py#L180](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/knowledge_graph.py#L180), [knowledge_graph.py#L196](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/knowledge_graph.py#L196), [knowledge_graph.py#L282](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/knowledge_graph.py#L282), [memory-search.ts#L482](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/handlers/memory-search.ts#L482)
- **What it does**: MemPalace keeps a separate SQLite fact store with `entities`, `triples`, `valid_from`, and `valid_to`, plus dedicated add/query/invalidate/timeline operations. That separation is real and useful: it prevents temporal facts from being conflated with raw drawer retrieval.
- **Why it matters for us**: Public currently has strong recall/search and causal links, but not a fact plane with temporal invalidation semantics. Integration difficulty is **high** because this would need governed fact extraction, citation requirements, correction workflows, and clear authority boundaries between facts and verbatim memories. The architecture is worth exploring, but only as a stricter Public-native subsystem.
- **Recommendation**: prototype later
- **Impact**: high

## Assessment
- New information ratio: 0.74
- Questions addressed: hook timing feasibility, protocol/bootstrap portability, wake-up layering fit, taxonomy integration cost, temporal KG separation, benchmark truthfulness boundaries, Public overlap analysis
- Questions answered: the most feasible MemPalace transfers are compaction-time preservation and status-level behavior guidance; the least attractive is full palace taxonomy; the highest-upside but hardest item is a separate governed temporal fact plane

## Reflection
- What worked: tracing implementation files side-by-side with Public’s current recovery and compaction code made the feasibility split much clearer than README claims alone
- What did not work: this environment is read-only, the phase folder is still missing the expected Level 3 docs, and the validator reported `PASSED` while also emitting `cannot create temp file for here document: Operation not permitted`, so I could not produce compliant packet artifacts or trust the validation signal as a full closeout gate

## Recommended Next Focus
Prototype one Public-native compaction checkpoint that reuses the existing compaction hook surface, emits a short memory protocol in bootstrap/status output, and writes only structured JSON-primary evidence through `generate-context.js`; defer any taxonomy or temporal-KG work until that preservation path is proven.

RESEARCH BRIEF:
# $refine TIDD-EC Prompt: 005-mempalace

## 2. Role

You are a research specialist in verbatim AI memory systems, ChromaDB-based semantic retrieval, navigable memory taxonomies, wake-up context layering, MCP tool design, hook-driven persistence, and local temporal knowledge graphs. Work like a systems analyst who can separate README positioning from verified Python mechanics, trace how MemPalace composes mining, storage, retrieval, hooks, and protocol guidance, and translate those choices into practical improvements for `Code_Environment/Public`.

## 3. Task

Research MemPalace's raw-verbatim memory architecture, palace taxonomy, wake-up stack, MCP protocol/tooling, hook-driven save flow, and temporal knowledge-graph patterns to identify practical, evidence-backed improvements for `Code_Environment/Public`, especially around session continuity, compaction survival, memory hygiene, and agent-facing recall ergonomics. Determine which MemPalace ideas should be `adopt now`, `prototype later`, or `reject`. Keep the analysis honest about what is source-confirmed, what is README-documented, and what is benchmark-claim territory.

## 4. Context

### 4.1 System Description

MemPalace is a local Python memory system centered on a strong design claim: keep raw conversation and project text instead of extracting only summarized facts, then make that verbatim corpus searchable and navigable. The external repo exposes a CLI, an MCP server, hook scripts, a ChromaDB-backed drawer store, a wake-up layering system, and a separate SQLite temporal knowledge graph. Its storage model uses palace terminology: wings for people/projects/topics, halls for shared memory categories, rooms for named ideas, closets for compact summaries, and drawers for original verbatim content.

The most important architectural tension in this phase is that MemPalace mixes strong implementation ideas with aggressive README claims that the project itself partially corrects in its April 7, 2026 note. The raw-verbatim result is the standout claim; AAAK is explicitly experimental and lossy; contradiction detection is documented as incomplete; and some benchmark or rerank claims live more in docs than in source. This phase should reward the underlying architecture where the code supports it, but it must not let benchmark marketing or future-looking README language blur the evidence line.

The repo appears to support three ingestion shapes into one shared memory backend: project mining, conversation mining, and a general heuristic extraction mode. Retrieval then spans direct semantic search, wake-up text generation across L0-L3 layers, palace graph traversal via shared room metadata, and MCP tooling that teaches an operational memory protocol to the agent through the status response itself. Hook scripts add another layer: instead of a memory system that only responds to explicit search/save calls, MemPalace also tries to shape the timing of memory writes at stop and pre-compact boundaries.

### 4.2 Cross-Phase Awareness Table

| Phase | System | Core Pattern | Overlap Risk | Differentiation |
|-------|--------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|
| 001 | Engram | MCP memory server (Go, SQLite+FTS5) | 005 (memory server), 004 (session continuity) | Focus tool profiles, session lifecycle, topic keys |
| 002 | Mex | Markdown scaffold + drift detection | 005 (project knowledge) | Focus drift detection, scaffold structure, no-DB approach |
| 003 | Modus Memory | FSRS spaced repetition + BM25 | 005 (local memory) | Focus FSRS decay, BM25, librarian expansion, cross-references |
| 004 | OpenCode Mnemosyne | Hybrid search (FTS5 + vector) | 005 (compaction, hybrid retrieval claims) | Focus plugin architecture, project/global scoping, wrapper boundary |
| 005 | MemPalace | Raw verbatim storage + palace taxonomy + hooks + temporal KG | 001 (MCP memory), 004 (compaction/helping memory survive), 003 (local memory) | Focus raw-no-extraction posture, wake-up layers, hooks, palace structure, temporal KG |

### 4.3 What This Repo Already Has

`Code_Environment/Public` already has Spec Kit Memory with hybrid retrieval, `memory_search`, `memory_context`, `memory_match_triggers`, memory-save flows through `generate-context.js`, session/bootstrap handling in the memory MCP server, and compaction-oriented structural transport via `.opencode/plugins/spec-kit-compact-code-graph.js`. It also already has semantic code search via CocoIndex and structured graph context via Compact Code Graph.

What it does **not** currently have is a raw-verbatim-by-default memory posture comparable to MemPalace's drawer model, a first-class wing/hall/room taxonomy for agent memory navigation, a dedicated L0/L1/L2/L3 wake-up stack for context loading, MemPalace-style stop/pre-compact save hooks that actively block to force preservation, or a separate temporal entity-triple knowledge graph with explicit invalidation alongside the main memory store. The comparison should stay anchored to those gaps rather than repeating generic hybrid-RAG analysis already covered elsewhere.

## 5. Instructions

1. Treat `/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace` as the pre-approved phase folder. Skip Gate 3, keep all writes inside this phase folder, and treat everything under `external/` as read-only.
2. Read the governing Public repo `AGENTS.md` first. Then explicitly verify whether `external/AGENTS.md` exists. If it does not, note that absence as evidence about repo scope rather than inventing external workflow constraints.
3. Before deep research begins, ensure this phase folder contains Level 3 Spec Kit docs: `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`, `checklist.md`, and `decision-record.md`.
4. Use `@speckit` for markdown authoring when the runtime supports agent routing. If routing is unavailable, preserve existing Spec Kit Level 3 structure manually without creating side-channel docs outside the phase folder.
5. Start with `external/README.md`, but read it critically. Cover these sections in order: the April 7, 2026 correction note; Quick Start; How You Actually Use It; The Palace; wake-up / AAAK sections; MCP tools; benchmark sections. Capture both the architecture claims and the repo's own admitted overstatements.
6. Immediately after the README, read `external/pyproject.toml` and `external/mempalace/cli.py`. Confirm the actual runtime boundary, command surface, install assumptions, and the core flows for `init`, `mine`, `search`, `wake-up`, `status`, `repair`, and `compress`.
7. Trace the MCP surface end to end in `external/mempalace/mcp_server.py`. Focus on tool registration, read/write split, stderr logging behavior, `PALACE_PROTOCOL`, `AAAK_SPEC`, status bootstrap behavior, duplicate checking, graph tools, knowledge-graph tools, diary tools, and what the tool names imply about agent discipline.
8. Trace retrieval and context loading next in `external/mempalace/searcher.py` and `external/mempalace/layers.py`. Capture the raw ChromaDB query path, wing/room filtering, L0/L1/L2/L3 layering, wake-up token assumptions, and how much of that layering is implementation versus README framing.
9. Trace structural navigation next in `external/mempalace/palace_graph.py` and `external/mempalace/knowledge_graph.py`. Keep these separate in your notes: palace graph traversal is metadata-derived from ChromaDB rooms/halls/wings, while the knowledge graph is a separate SQLite temporal triple store with invalidation.
10. Trace ingestion behavior next. Read `external/mempalace/miner.py`, `external/mempalace/convo_miner.py`, `external/mempalace/general_extractor.py`, and `external/mempalace/onboarding.py`. Focus on chunking strategy, room detection, no-summary posture, heuristic extraction, onboarding assumptions, and whether the system truly keeps everything or selectively restructures it during ingest.
11. Read hook and benchmark artifacts after the implementation core: `external/hooks/README.md`, `external/hooks/mempal_save_hook.sh`, `external/hooks/mempal_precompact_hook.sh`, and `external/benchmarks/BENCHMARKS.md`. Treat these as crucial to the product story, but distinguish carefully between executable behavior, experimental behavior, and benchmark claims that require caution.
12. Compare MemPalace directly against current `Code_Environment/Public` code: `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/handlers/memory-search.ts`, `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/context-server.ts`, `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/dist/memory/generate-context.js`, and `.opencode/plugins/spec-kit-compact-code-graph.js`. Be explicit about what Public already covers better and what MemPalace still contributes.
13. Before the main research pass, validate the phase folder with this exact command:
    ```bash
    cd /Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public && bash .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/spec/validate.sh "/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace" --strict
    ```
14. After validation passes, run `spec_kit:deep-research` with this exact topic:
    ```text
    Research the external repository at /Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external and identify concrete improvements for Code_Environment/Public, especially around raw verbatim memory storage, palace taxonomy (wings/halls/rooms), wake-up context layering, MCP protocol/tool design, hook-driven save flows, and temporal knowledge-graph patterns.
    ```
15. Save all outputs inside `research/`, with `research/research.md` as the canonical report. Every meaningful finding must cite exact file paths, say whether the evidence is `source-confirmed`, `README-documented`, `benchmark-documented`, or mixed, explain why it matters for `Code_Environment/Public`, classify the recommendation as `adopt now`, `prototype later`, or `reject`, identify the affected subsystem, and note migration or truthfulness risk. When research is complete, update `checklist.md`, create `implementation-summary.md`, and save memory with:
    ```bash
    cd /Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public && node .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/dist/memory/generate-context.js "/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace"
    ```

## 6. Research Questions

1. What does MemPalace gain from its raw-verbatim "store everything, then make it findable" posture, and where would that improve or conflict with Spec Kit Memory's more selective save and retrieval model?
2. How useful is the wing / hall / room / closet / drawer taxonomy in practice: does it materially improve navigation and recall, or does it mostly reframe metadata filtering in memorable language?
3. How does the L0/L1/L2/L3 wake-up stack compare with Public's `session_bootstrap`, `memory_context`, and compaction-recovery flows, and what parts of the layering model are reusable here?
4. What does `mcp_server.py` gain by embedding `PALACE_PROTOCOL` and `AAAK_SPEC` directly in the status bootstrap, and could Public benefit from similarly direct memory-usage guidance without adding prompt clutter?
5. How effective are the stop-hook and pre-compact-hook patterns at protecting context before loss, and how do they compare to Public's existing compaction-oriented structural plugin and memory-save workflows?
6. What are the real architectural consequences of keeping the temporal knowledge graph separate from the drawer store, especially around invalidation, diary entries, and fact-vs-verbatim boundaries?
7. How much of MemPalace's benchmark story is supported directly by code in this repo, and which claims should remain benchmark candidates or doc-level references rather than implementation truths?
8. How do `miner.py`, `convo_miner.py`, and `general_extractor.py` balance "store everything" against chunking, heuristics, room assignment, and extraction side paths?
9. Which MemPalace ideas most improve compaction survival and startup continuity for future Public sessions: wake-up layers, hook timing, memory protocol bootstrapping, diary writing, or taxonomy-based narrowing?
10. Which MemPalace features are genuinely reusable architecture, and which are presentation choices, experimental layers, or hype-prone claims that Public should not copy?
11. How should AAAK be evaluated honestly: as a useful optional compression dialect, a still-unproven context-loading experiment, or mostly a distraction from the stronger raw-verbatim baseline?

## 7. Do's

- Do distinguish raw verbatim storage from AAAK compression; they are not the same feature and do not have the same evidence quality.
- Do separate palace graph traversal from the temporal knowledge graph; one is metadata-derived navigation and the other is explicit fact storage with validity windows.
- Do inspect the actual hook scripts, not just their README, so the analysis captures the precise blocking behavior before save and compaction.
- Do compare MemPalace's wake-up flow against current Public bootstrap and compaction behavior using real Public files.
- Do treat the April 7, 2026 correction note as important evidence about truthfulness boundaries and product honesty.
- Do analyze how status/bootstrap responses teach the agent what to do, not just what data they return.
- Do map strong findings to specific Public subsystems such as Spec Kit Memory retrieval, context bootstrap, save flows, or compaction handling.

## 8. Don'ts

- Do not describe MemPalace as "just ChromaDB search"; the repo's differentiators are raw-storage posture, wake-up layers, hooks, taxonomy, and KG split.
- Do not treat README benchmark numbers as fully source-proven implementation facts unless the repo actually exposes the relevant pipeline.
- Do not recommend copying AAAK or benchmark marketing language wholesale into Public planning.
- Do not collapse this phase into generic hybrid-RAG analysis already owned by earlier phases.
- Do not ignore the repo's admitted inaccuracies or unresolved claims; they are central to evaluating whether an idea is production-worthy.
- Do not overlook the difference between "AI remembers because storage exists" and "AI remembers because the protocol tells it when and how to use storage."
- Do not edit anything under `external/` or outside this phase folder.

## 9. Examples

### Example A: Wake-up and protocol finding

```text
**Finding: Status doubles as a behavior bootstrap, not just a health check**
- Source: external/mempalace/mcp_server.py; external/mempalace/layers.py
- Evidence type: source-confirmed
- What it does: `mempalace_status` returns palace overview data plus `PALACE_PROTOCOL` and `AAAK_SPEC`, while the wake-up stack separately loads L0/L1 context for cheap startup continuity.
- Why it matters: Public already has resume/bootstrap tooling, but it does not currently use one memory-facing status surface to teach concrete retrieval and save behavior this directly.
- Recommendation: prototype later
- Affected area: memory bootstrap UX, session recovery guidance, compaction recovery behavior
- Risk/cost: Medium; could add prompt noise or duplicate existing guidance if not scoped carefully
```

### Example B: Hook-driven preservation finding

```text
**Finding: Save timing is enforced by hooks, not left to agent initiative alone**
- Source: external/hooks/mempal_save_hook.sh; external/hooks/mempal_precompact_hook.sh; external/hooks/README.md
- Evidence type: source-confirmed + README-documented
- What it does: the stop hook blocks every N human exchanges and the pre-compact hook always blocks, forcing the agent to preserve key context before loss.
- Why it matters: Public has compaction-oriented structural transport, but it does not currently enforce a comparable memory-preservation checkpoint before context collapse.
- Recommendation: adopt now or prototype later, depending on runtime surface
- Affected area: memory save automation, compaction resilience, agent operating protocol
- Risk/cost: Medium; intrusive save prompts and duplicate writes need guardrails
```

## 10. Constraints

### 10.1 Error handling

- If a README or benchmark claim is not directly supported by source, label it clearly as documentation- or benchmark-level evidence rather than implementation fact.
- If MemPalace's docs contradict its code or its own April 2026 correction note, prefer source evidence and call out the contradiction explicitly.
- If comparison assumptions about current `Code_Environment/Public` behavior are outdated, correct them in the research instead of preserving stale framing.
- If the external repo structure differs from the paths named here, preserve the same analytical order and document the actual files used.

### 10.2 Scope

**IN SCOPE**

- raw verbatim storage and no-summary posture
- palace taxonomy: wings, halls, rooms, closets, drawers
- L0/L1/L2/L3 wake-up layering
- MCP server design, status bootstrap, protocol guidance, diary tools
- stop and pre-compact hook behavior
- temporal knowledge graph and invalidation model
- mining modes, chunking, heuristics, onboarding
- benchmark and README truthfulness boundaries
- comparison against current Public memory, bootstrap, save, and compaction flows

**OUT OF SCOPE**

- generic Python style commentary
- speculative cloud scaling or hosted-service redesigns
- broad vector-database taxonomy disconnected from MemPalace evidence
- re-litigating BM25/FSRS/plugin topics already owned by earlier phases
- editing or fixing MemPalace itself

### 10.3 Prioritization framework

Rank findings in this order: leverage for Public session continuity, compaction-survival value, truthfulness and evidence quality, fit with current Spec Kit Memory capabilities, operational simplicity, memory-hygiene impact, and clean differentiation from phases `001` through `004`.

## 11. Deliverables

- `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`, `checklist.md`, and `decision-record.md` present and valid before deep research starts
- `research/research.md` as the canonical report with at least 5 evidence-backed findings
- explicit comparison against current Public memory retrieval, bootstrap, save, and compaction behavior
- each finding labeled `adopt now`, `prototype later`, or `reject`
- each finding states evidence type: `source-confirmed`, `README-documented`, `benchmark-documented`, or mixed
- `implementation-summary.md` created at the end
- memory saved from this phase folder using `generate-context.js`

Minimum finding schema:

- finding title
- exact source evidence
- evidence type
- what MemPalace does
- why it matters for `Code_Environment/Public`
- recommendation: `adopt now`, `prototype later`, or `reject`
- affected subsystem
- migration, ambiguity, or truthfulness risk

## 12. Evaluation Criteria

- CLEAR target: `>= 40/50`
- RICCE compliance is visible in the prompt:
  - **Role** is specialized in verbatim memory systems, wake-up layering, MCP protocol design, hooks, and temporal KG behavior
  - **Instructions** are ordered, concrete, path-specific, and honest about evidence boundaries
  - **Context** is domain-specific, cross-phase aware, and corrected for current Public capabilities
  - **Constraints** clearly separate source-confirmed behavior from README or benchmark claims
  - **Examples** show strong MemPalace-derived findings about protocol bootstrapping and hook-driven preservation
- at least 5 findings are evidence-backed rather than speculative
- findings explicitly separate raw-mode strengths from AAAK's experimental status
- findings compare MemPalace against today's Public bootstrap and compaction behavior rather than a stale baseline
- cross-phase overlap with `001` through `004` is explicitly bounded so this phase stays focused on raw-verbatim architecture, wake-up layers, hooks, and KG split

## 13. Completion Bar

The phase is only complete when all of the following are true:

- the reading order covered README honesty notes, CLI/runtime boundaries, MCP server, retrieval layers, palace graph, temporal KG, ingest pipeline, hooks, and benchmarks
- current `Code_Environment/Public` memory/bootstrap/compaction behavior was compared using code, not assumptions
- the validation command passed on this exact phase folder
- the exact deep-research topic string appears in the work
- `research/research.md` contains at least 5 evidence-backed findings
- each finding distinguishes source-confirmed behavior from README or benchmark claims where needed
- `checklist.md` is updated with evidence and completion marks
- `implementation-summary.md` exists
- memory is saved successfully for `005-mempalace`
- no edits were made outside this phase folder
- recommendations explicitly address raw storage, taxonomy, wake-up layering, hooks, and temporal KG patterns

OUTPUT FORMAT (MANDATORY - follow this exactly):

codex
I’m treating this as a read-only research pass on MemPalace’s implementation, centered on adoption risk rather than feature recap. I’ll verify the scoped instructions and relevant prior context first, then trace the external code and compare it directly against Public’s current memory/bootstrap surfaces.

## 1. 🚨 CRITICAL RULES

### Safety Constraints

**HARD BLOCKERS (The "Four Laws" of Agent Safety):**
1. **READ FIRST:** Never edit a file without reading it first. Understand context before modifying.
2. **SCOPE LOCK:** Only modify files explicitly in scope. **NO** "cleaning up" or "improving" adjacent code. Scope in `spec.md` is FROZEN.
3. **VERIFY:** Syntax checks and tests **MUST** pass before claiming completion. **NO** blind commits.
4. **HALT:** Stop immediately if uncertain, if line numbers don't match, or if tests fail.

**HALT CONDITIONS (Stop and Report):**
- [ ] Target file does not exist or line numbers don't match.
- [ ] Syntax check or Tests fail after edit.
- [ ] Merge conflicts encountered.
- [ ] Edit tool reports "string not found".
- [ ] Test/Production boundary is unclear.

**OPERATIONAL MANDATES:**
- **All file modifications require a spec folder** (Gate 3).
- **Never lie or fabricate** — use "UNKNOWN" when uncertain.
- **Clarify** if confidence < 80% (see §4 Confidence Framework).
- **Use explicit uncertainty:** Prefix claims with "I'M UNCERTAIN ABOUT THIS:".

---

### Request Analysis & Execution

**Flow:** Parse request → Read files first → Analyze → Design simplest solution → Validate → Execute

#### Execution Behavior

- **Plan before acting** on multi-step work. Decide which files to read first, which tools to use, and how the result will be verified before making changes.
- **Use a research-first approach.** Read the actual code, docs, and local instructions first. Never use an edit-first approach, and prefer surgical edits over broad rewrites.
- **Apply project-specific conventions from `CLAUDE.md` files** before acting.
- **Take responsibility for issues encountered during execution.** Do not dodge ownership with phrases like `not caused by my changes` or `pre-existing issue`; work toward the fix.
- **Do not stop early when the requested solution is still incomplete.** Do not frame partial progress as a `good stopping point`, `natural checkpoint`, or `future work` when a safe path forward exists.
- **Do not ask for permission to continue when the next safe step is already clear and in scope.** Avoid `should I continue?` or `want me to keep going?` when you can proceed safely under the existing rules.
- **Use frequent self-checks and reasoning loops** to catch and fix your own mistakes before asking for help.
- **Reason from actual data, not assumptions.** Verify against the real files, outputs, and behavior in front of you.

---

### Tools & Search

**MANDATORY TOOLS:**
- **Spec Kit Memory MCP** — research tasks, context recovery, finding prior work. Memory saves MUST use `node .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/dist/memory/generate-context.js` — NEVER manually create memory files.
  - AI composes structured JSON → `generate-context.js --json '{"specFolder":"...","sessionSummary":"..."}' [spec-folder]` or writes to `/tmp/save-context-data.json` and passes as first arg.
- **CocoIndex Code MCP** — semantic code search. MUST use when exploring unfamiliar code, finding implementations by concept/intent, or when Grep/Glob exact matching is insufficient. Skill: `.opencode/skill/mcp-coco-index/`
- **Git (sk-git)** — worktree setup, conventional commits, PR creation. Full details: `.opencode/skill/sk-git/`. Trigger keywords: worktree, branch, commit, merge, pr, pull request, git workflow, finish work, integrate changes

**CODE SEARCH DECISION TREE:**

```text
Need to find code?
  |
  +-- Know the exact text/token/symbol?
  |     YES --> Grep (exact match)
  |
  +-- Know the file name or path?
  |     YES --> Glob (pattern match)
  |
  +-- Searching by concept, intent, or "how does X work"?
  |     YES --> CocoIndex search (semantic)
  |             +-- Verify hits with Read
  |             +-- Confirm with Grep if needed
  |
  +-- Exploring unfamiliar code?
        YES --> CocoIndex search FIRST, then Grep/Glob to fill gaps
```

CocoIndex triggers: "find code that does X", "how is X implemented", "where is the logic for X", "similar code", "find patterns", exploring unfamiliar modules, any intent-based query where exact tokens are unknown.

| Approach | Command | When |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **MCP tool** | `search(query, languages, paths, num_results, refresh_index)` | AI agent integration |
| **CLI** | `ccc search "query" --lang X --path Y --limit N` | Direct terminal use |

Set `refresh_index=false` after the first search in a session unless the codebase changed.

---

### Session Start & Recovery

**Hook-capable runtimes** auto-inject startup context — no manual action needed. 
**Fallback** — when hooks fail or are unavailable in any runtime:

1. Call `session_bootstrap()` — one composite call that runs `session_resume` + `session_health` and returns structural context
2. If structural context shows `stale` or `missing`, run `code_graph_scan` to rebuild
3. If the graph remains unavailable, fall back to CocoIndex + direct file reads
4. Re-anchor on the recovered spec folder, current task, blockers, and next steps before making changes

---

### Quality & Anti-Patterns

**QUALITY PRINCIPLES:**
- **Prefer simplicity**, reuse existing patterns, and cite evidence with sources
- Solve only the stated problem; **avoid over-engineering** and premature optimization
- **Verify with checks** (simplicity, performance, maintainability, scope) before making changes
- **Truth over agreement** — correct user misconceptions with evidence; do not agree for conversational flow

**ANTI-PATTERNS (Detect Silently):**

| Anti-Pattern           | Trigger Phrases                                 | Response                                                                    |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Over-engineering       | "for flexibility", "future-proof", "might need" | Ask: "Is this solving a current problem or a hypothetical one?"             |
| Premature optimization | "could be slow", "might bottleneck"             | Ask: "Has this been measured? What's the actual performance?"               |
| Cargo culting          | "best practice", "always should"                | Ask: "Does this pattern fit this specific case?"                            |
| Gold-plating           | "while we're here", "might as well"             | Flag scope creep: "That's a separate change - shall I note it for later?"   |
| Wrong abstraction      | "DRY this up" for 2 instances                   | "These look similar but might not be the same concept. Let's verify first." |
| Scope creep            | "also add", "bonus feature"                     | "That's outside the current scope. Want to track it separately?"            |

**ANALYSIS LENSES:**

| Lens               | Focus            | Detection Questions                                                                |
| ------------------ | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **CLARITY**        | Simplicity       | Is this the simplest code that solves the problem? Are abstractions earned?        |
| **SYSTEMS**        | Dependencies     | What does this change touch? What calls this? What are the side effects?           |
| **BIAS**           | Wrong problem    | Is user solving a symptom? Is this premature optimization? Is the framing correct? |
| **SUSTAINABILITY** | Maintainability  | Will future devs understand this? Is it self-documenting? Tech debt implications?  |
| **VALUE**          | Actual impact    | Does this change behavior or just refactor? Is it cosmetic or functional?          |
| **SCOPE**          | Complexity match | Does solution complexity match problem size? Single-line fix or new abstraction?   |

## 2. ⛔ MANDATORY GATES - STOP BEFORE ACTING

**⚠️ BEFORE using ANY tool (except Gate Actions: memory_match_triggers, skill_advisor.py), you MUST pass all applicable gates below.**

### 🔒 PRE-EXECUTION GATES (Pass before ANY tool use)

#### GATE 1: UNDERSTANDING + CONTEXT SURFACING [SOFT] BLOCK
Trigger: EACH new user message (re-evaluate even in ongoing conversations)
1. Call `memory_match_triggers(prompt)` → Surface relevant context
2. Classify intent: Research or Implementation
3. Parse request → Check confidence AND uncertainty (see §4)
4. **Dual-threshold:** confidence ≥ 0.70 AND uncertainty ≤ 0.35 → PROCEED. Either fails → INVESTIGATE (max 3 iterations) → ESCALATE. Simple: <40% ASK | 40-69% CAUTION | ≥70% PASS

> Gate 1 is SOFT — if file modification detected, Gate 3 (HARD) takes precedence. Ask spec folder question BEFORE analysis.

####  GATE 2: SKILL ROUTING [REQUIRED for non-trivial tasks]
1. A) Run: `python3 .opencode/skill/scripts/skill_advisor.py "[request]" --threshold 0.8`
2. B) Cite user's explicit direction: "User specified: [exact quote]"
- Confidence ≥ 0.8 → MUST invoke skill | < 0.8 → general approach | User names skill → cite and proceed
- Output: `SKILL ROUTING: [result]` or `SKILL ROUTING: User directed → [name]`
- Skip: trivial queries only (greetings, single-line questions)

#### GATE 3: SPEC FOLDER QUESTION [HARD] BLOCK — PRIORITY GATE
- **Overrides Gates 1-2:** If file modification detected → ask Gate 3 BEFORE any analysis/tool calls
- **Triggers:** rename, move, delete, create, add, remove, update, change, modify, edit, fix, refactor, implement, build, write, generate, configure, analyze, decompose, phase — or any task resulting in file changes
- **Options:** A) Existing | B) New | C) Update related | D) Skip | E) Phase folder (e.g., `specs/NNN-name/001-phase/`)
- **DO NOT** use Read/Edit/Write/Bash (except Gate Actions) before asking. ASK FIRST, wait for response, THEN proceed
- **Session persistence:** Once the user answers Gate 3 in a conversation, that answer applies for the ENTIRE session. Do NOT re-ask on subsequent messages unless the user explicitly starts a completely different task/feature. Follow-up messages, implementation steps, and phase transitions within the same task reuse the original answer.
- **Re-ask ONLY when:** the user says "new task" / "different feature" / explicitly names a different spec folder, OR the user asks you to re-ask.

#### CONSOLIDATED QUESTION PROTOCOL
When multiple inputs are needed, consolidate into a SINGLE prompt — never split across messages. Include only applicable questions; omit when pre-determined.
- **Round-trip optimization** — Only 1 user interaction needed for setup
- **First Message Protocol** — ALL questions asked BEFORE any analysis or tool calls
- **Violation:** Multiple separate prompts → STOP, apologize, re-present as single prompt
- **Bypass phrases:** "skip context" / "fresh start" / "skip memory" / [skip] for memory loading; Level 1 tasks skip completion verification

---

### 🔒 POST-EXECUTION RULES

#### MEMORY SAVE RULE [HARD] BLOCK
Trigger: "save context", "save memory", `/memory:save`, memory file creation
- If spec folder established at Gate 3 → USE IT (don't re-ask). Carry-over applies ONLY to memory saves
- If NO folder and Gate 3 never answered → HARD BLOCK → Ask user
- **Script:** `node .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/dist/memory/generate-context.js`
  - AI composes structured JSON with session context, writes to `/tmp/save-context-data.json`, passes as first arg. Alternatively use `--json '<inline-json>'` or `--stdin`. The AI has strictly better information about its own session than any DB extraction.
  - Subfolder: `003-parent/121-child` or bare `121-child` (auto-searches parents)
- **Indexing:** For immediate MCP visibility after save: `memory_index_scan({ specFolder })` or `memory_save()`
- **Violation:** Write tool on `memory/` path → DELETE and re-run via script
- **Post-Save Review:** After `generate-context.js` completes, check the POST-SAVE QUALITY REVIEW output.
  - **HIGH** issues: MUST manually patch via Edit tool (fix title, trigger_phrases, importance_tier)
  - **MEDIUM** issues: patch when practical
  - **PASSED/SKIPPED**: no action needed

#### COMPLETION VERIFICATION RULE [HARD] BLOCK
Trigger: Claiming "done", "complete", "finished", "works"
1. Validation runs automatically on spec folder (if exists)
2. Load `checklist.md` → Verify ALL items → Mark `[x]` with evidence
- Skip: Level 1 tasks (no checklist.md required) | Exit 0 = pass, Exit 1 = warnings, Exit 2 = errors (must fix)

#### VIOLATION RECOVERY [SELF-CORRECTION]
Trigger: About to skip gates, or realized gates were skipped → STOP → STATE: "Before I proceed, I need to ask about documentation:" → ASK Gate 3 (A/B/C/D/E) → WAIT
- **Exception:** If the user already answered Gate 3 earlier in this conversation for the same task, do NOT re-ask. Reuse the existing answer and proceed.

#### Self-Check (before ANY tool-using response):
- [ ] File modification? Asked spec folder question?
- [ ] Skill routing verified?
- [ ] Saving memory? Using `generate-context.js` (not Write tool)?
- [ ] Aligned with ORIGINAL request? No scope drift?
- [ ] Claiming completion? `checklist.md` verified?

# Autonomous Deep Research Loop

Iterative research protocol with fresh context per iteration, externalized state, and convergence detection for deep technical investigation.

Runtime path resolution:
- OpenCode/Copilot runtime: `.opencode/agent/*.md`
- Claude runtime: `.claude/agents/*.md`
- Codex runtime: `.codex/agents/*.toml`

<!-- ANCHOR:when-to-use -->
## 1. WHEN TO USE

### When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Deep investigation requiring multiple rounds of discovery
- Topic spans 3+ technical domains or sources
- Initial findings need progressive refinement
- Overnight or unattended research sessions
- Research where prior findings inform subsequent queries

### When NOT to Use

- Simple, single-question research (use direct codebase search or `/spec_kit:plan`)
- Known-solution documentation (use `/spec_kit:plan`)
- Implementation tasks (use `/spec_kit:implement`)
- Quick codebase searches (use `@context` or direct Grep/Glob)
- Fewer than 3 sources needed (single-pass research suffices)

### Keyword Triggers

`autoresearch`, `deep research`, `autonomous research`, `research loop`, `iterative research`, `multi-round research`, `deep investigation`, `comprehensive research`

For iterative code review and quality auditing, see `sk-deep-review`.

### Lifecycle Contract

Live lifecycle branches:
- `resume` — continue the active lineage
- `restart` — start a new generation with explicit parent linkage
- `fork` — branch from the current packet state
- `completed-continue` — reopen a completed lineage only after immutable synthesis snapshotting

### Phase Detection

Detect the current research phase from dispatch context to load appropriate resources:

| Phase | Signal | Resources to Load |
|-------|--------|-------------------|
| Init | No JSONL exists | Loop protocol, state format |
| Iteration | Dispatch context includes iteration number | Loop protocol, convergence |
| Stuck | Dispatch context includes "RECOVERY" | Convergence, loop protocol |
| Synthesis | Convergence triggered STOP | Quick reference |

### Core Innovation: Fresh Context Per Iteration

Each agent dispatch gets a fresh context window. State continuity comes from files, not memory. This solves context degradation in long research sessions.

Adapted from: karpathy/autoresearch (loop concept), AGR (fresh context "Ralph Loop"), pi-autoresearch (JSONL state), autoresearch-opencode (context injection).

### Data Flow

```
Init --> Create config.json, strategy.md, state.jsonl
  |
Loop --> Read state --> Check convergence --> Dispatch @deep-research
  |                                              |
  |                                              v
  |                                         Agent executes:
  |                                         1. Read state files
  |                                         2. Determine focus
  |                                         3. Research (3-5 actions)
  |                                         4. Write iteration-NNN.md
  |                                         5. Update strategy.md
  |                                         6. Append state.jsonl
  |                                              |
  +<--- Evaluate results <-----------------------+
  |
  +--- Continue? --> Yes: next iteration
  |                  No: exit loop
  v
Synthesize --> Compile final research/research.md
  |
Save --> generate-context.js --> verify memory artifact
```

### Key Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Externalized state** | All research continuity via files, not agent memory |
| **Fresh context** | Each iteration gets a clean agent with no prior context |
| **Convergence** | Multi-signal detection: newInfoRatio, stuck count, questions answered |
| **Strategy file** | Reducer-synchronized research steering with machine-owned sections |
| **JSONL log** | Append-only structured log for lineage and iteration data |
| **Findings registry** | Reducer-owned open/resolved questions, key findings, and ruled-out directions |

I’ve confirmed two useful bits of setup: there’s prior memory specifically about `005-mempalace`, and the deep-research skill matches this workflow. Next I’m using memory and semantic code search as a quick orienting pass, then I’ll read the concrete implementation files in the order your brief specifies.

The MCP shortcuts didn’t cooperate in this session, so I’m falling back to direct file inspection and exact searches in the scoped repo. I’m checking the external phase structure, the presence of `external/AGENTS.md`, and the current Level 3 doc state before tracing the implementation itself.

The phase folder is materially incomplete in this checkout: all expected Level 3 docs are missing, yet `validate.sh --strict` still returned `PASSED` after emitting `cannot create temp file for here document: Operation not permitted`. I’m treating that as a trust boundary issue and continuing the research as a read-only evidence pass, while I trace the actual external code and not the validator’s verdict.

7:### The highest-scoring AI memory system ever benchmarked. And it's free.
15:**The Palace** — Ancient Greek orators memorized entire speeches by placing ideas in rooms of an imaginary building. Walk through the building, find the idea. MemPalace applies the same principle to AI memory: your conversations are organized into wings (people and projects), halls (types of memory), and rooms (specific ideas). No AI decides what matters — you keep every word, and the structure gives you a navigable map instead of a flat search index.
19:**AAAK (experimental)** — A lossy abbreviation dialect for packing repeated entities into fewer tokens at scale. Readable by any LLM that reads text — Claude, GPT, Gemini, Llama, Mistral — no decoder needed. **AAAK is a separate compression layer, not the storage default**, and on the LongMemEval benchmark it currently regresses vs raw mode (84.2% vs 96.6%). We're iterating. See the [note above](#a-note-from-milla--ben--april-7-2026) for the honest status.

46:<sub>Reproducible — runners in <a href="benchmarks/">benchmarks/</a>. <a href="benchmarks/BENCHMARKS.md">Full results</a>. The 96.6% is from <b>raw verbatim mode</b>, not AAAK or rooms mode (those score lower — see <a href="#a-note-from-milla--ben--april-7-2026">note above</a>).</sub>
52:## A Note from Milla & Ben — April 7, 2026
58:> - **The AAAK token example was incorrect.** We used a rough heuristic (`len(text)//3`) for token counts instead of an actual tokenizer. Real counts via OpenAI's tokenizer: the English example is 66 tokens, the AAAK example is 73. AAAK does not save tokens at small scales — it's designed for *repeated entities at scale*, and the README example was a bad demonstration of that. We're rewriting it.
60:> - **"30x lossless compression" was overstated.** AAAK is a lossy abbreviation system (entity codes, sentence truncation). Independent benchmarks show AAAK mode scores **84.2% R@5 vs raw mode's 96.6%** on LongMemEval — a 12.4 point regression. The honest framing is: AAAK is an experimental compression layer that trades fidelity for token density, and **the 96.6% headline number is from RAW mode, not AAAK**.
66:> - **"100% with Haiku rerank"** is real (we have the result files) but the rerank pipeline is not in the public benchmark scripts. We're adding it.
76:> 1. Rewriting the AAAK example with real tokenizer counts and a scenario where AAAK actually demonstrates compression
77:> 2. Adding `mode raw / aaak / rooms` clearly to the benchmark documentation so the trade-offs are visible
87:## Quick Start
111:## How You Actually Use It
126:### With Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, Gemini (MCP-compatible tools)
133:Now your AI has 19 tools available through MCP. Ask it anything:
143:Local models generally don't speak MCP yet. Two approaches:
148:mempalace wake-up > context.txt
152:This gives your local model ~170 tokens of critical facts (in AAAK if you prefer) before you ask a single question.
169:Either way — your entire memory stack runs offline. ChromaDB on your machine, Llama on your machine, AAAK for compression, zero cloud calls.
183:| **MemPalace wake-up** | **~170 tokens** | **~$0.70/yr** |
186:MemPalace loads 170 tokens of critical facts on wake-up — your team, your projects, your preferences. Then searches only when needed. $10/year to remember everything vs $507/year for summaries that lose context.
192:### The Palace
200:Every room has a **closet** connected to it, and here's where things get interesting. We've developed an AI language called **AAAK**. Don't ask — it's a whole story of its own. Your agent learns the AAAK shorthand every time it wakes up. Because AAAK is essentially English, but a very truncated version, your agent understands how to use it in seconds. It comes as part of the install, built into the MemPalace code. In our next update, we'll add AAAK directly to the closets, which will be a real game changer — the amount of info in the closets will be much bigger, but it will take up far less space and far less reading time for your agent.
202:Inside those closets are **drawers**, and those drawers are where your original files live. In this first version, we haven't used AAAK as a closet tool, but even so, the summaries have shown **96.6% recall** in all the benchmarks we've done across multiple benchmarking platforms. Once the closets use AAAK, searches will be even faster while keeping every word exact. But even now, the closet approach has been a huge boon to how much info is stored in a small space — it's used to easily point your AI agent to the drawer where your original file lives. You never lose anything, and all this happens in seconds.
242:**Closets** — summaries that point to the original content. (In v3.0.0 these are plain-text summaries; AAAK-encoded closets are coming in a future update — see [Task #30](https://github.com/milla-jovovich/mempalace/issues/30).)
280:| **L1** | Critical facts — team, projects, preferences | ~120 tokens (AAAK) | Always loaded |
286:### AAAK Dialect (experimental)
288:AAAK is a lossy abbreviation system — entity codes, structural markers, and sentence truncation — designed to pack repeated entities and relationships into fewer tokens at scale. It is **readable by any LLM that reads text** (Claude, GPT, Gemini, Llama, Mistral) without a decoder, so a local model can use it without any cloud dependency.
292:- **AAAK is lossy, not lossless.** It uses regex-based abbreviation, not reversible compression.
293:- **It does not save tokens at small scales.** Short text already tokenizes efficiently. AAAK overhead (codes, separators) costs more than it saves on a few sentences.
295:- **AAAK currently regresses LongMemEval** vs raw verbatim retrieval (84.2% R@5 vs 96.6%). The 96.6% headline number is from **raw mode**, not AAAK mode.
296:- **The MemPalace storage default is raw verbatim text in ChromaDB** — that's where the benchmark wins come from. AAAK is a separate compression layer for context loading, not the storage format.
431:- **Keeps a diary** — written in AAAK, persists across sessions
441:# → last 10 findings, compressed in AAAK

I’ve got the repo shape now. The strongest risk surfaces are emerging in four places: enforced save hooks, startup/bootstrap instruction injection, heuristic wake-up summarization, and the separate fact graph’s authority model. I’m pulling the exact code sections next so the final assessment can stay anchored to implementation rather than README claims.

   182	  ENTITIES: 3-letter uppercase codes. ALC=Alice, JOR=Jordan, RIL=Riley, MAX=Max, BEN=Ben.
   183	  EMOTIONS: *action markers* before/during text. *warm*=joy, *fierce*=determined, *raw*=vulnerable, *bloom*=tenderness.
   184	  STRUCTURE: Pipe-separated fields. FAM: family | PROJ: projects | ⚠: warnings/reminders.
   185	  DATES: ISO format (2026-03-31). COUNTS: Nx = N mentions (e.g., 570x).
   186	  IMPORTANCE: ★ to ★★★★★ (1-5 scale).
   187	  HALLS: hall_facts, hall_events, hall_discoveries, hall_preferences, hall_advice.
   188	  WINGS: wing_user, wing_agent, wing_team, wing_code, wing_myproject, wing_hardware, wing_ue5, wing_ai_research.

     2	knowledge_graph.py — Temporal Entity-Relationship Graph for MemPalace
     3	=====================================================================
     4	
     5	Real knowledge graph with:
     6	  - Entity nodes (people, projects, tools, concepts)
     7	  - Typed relationship edges (daughter_of, does, loves, works_on, etc.)
     8	  - Temporal validity (valid_from → valid_to — knows WHEN facts are true)
     9	  - Closet references (links back to the verbatim memory)
    10	
    11	Storage: SQLite (local, no dependencies, no subscriptions)
    12	Query: entity-first traversal with time filtering
    13	
    14	This is what competes with Zep's temporal knowledge graph.
    15	Zep uses Neo4j in the cloud ($25/mo+). We use SQLite locally (free).
    16	
    17	Usage:
    18	    from mempalace.knowledge_graph import KnowledgeGraph
    19	
    20	    kg = KnowledgeGraph()
    21	    kg.add_triple("Max", "child_of", "Alice", valid_from="2015-04-01")
    22	    kg.add_triple("Max", "does", "swimming", valid_from="2025-01-01")
    23	    kg.add_triple("Max", "loves", "chess", valid_from="2025-10-01")
    24	
    25	    # Query: everything about Max
    26	    kg.query_entity("Max")
    27	
    28	    # Query: what was true about Max in January 2026?
    29	    kg.query_entity("Max", as_of="2026-01-15")
    30	
    31	    # Query: who is connected to Alice?
    32	    kg.query_entity("Alice", direction="both")
    33	
    34	    # Invalidate: Max's sports injury resolved
    35	    kg.invalidate("Max", "has_issue", "sports_injury", ended="2026-02-15")

    62	Usage: node generate-context.js [options] <input>
    63	
    64	Arguments:
    65	  <input>           A JSON data file path
    66	                    - JSON file mode: node generate-context.js data.json [spec-folder]
    67	
    68	Options:
    69	  --help, -h        Show this help message
    70	  --stdin           Read structured JSON from stdin (preferred when a caller already has curated session data)
    71	  --json <string>   Read structured JSON from an inline string (preferred when structured data is available)
    72	  --session-id <uuid>  Explicit session ID to attach to the saved memory metadata
    73	
    74	Examples:
    75	  node generate-context.js /tmp/context-data.json
    76	  node generate-context.js /tmp/context-data.json specs/001-feature/
    77	  node generate-context.js /tmp/context-data.json .opencode/specs/001-feature/

    79	  node generate-context.js --json '{"specFolder":"specs/001-feature/"}'
    80	
    81	Output:
    82	  Creates a memory file in <spec-folder>/memory/ with ANCHOR format
    83	  for indexing by the Spec Kit Memory system.
    84	
    85	Preferred save path (JSON-PRIMARY):
    86	  - ALWAYS use --stdin, --json, or a JSON temp file.
    87	  - The AI has strictly better information about its own session than any DB query can reconstruct.
    88	  - Explicit CLI targets still outrank payload specFolder values in every structured-input mode.
    89	
    90	Direct CLI target rule:
    91	  - When a spec folder is passed on the CLI, that explicit target is authoritative.
    92	  - Session learning, JSON SPEC_FOLDER fields, and auto-detect may inform logging,
    93	    but they must not reroute the save to another folder.
    94	
    95	JSON Data Format (with preflight/postflight, session/git, and tool/exchange enrichment):
    96	  {
    97	    "user_prompts": [...],
    98	    "observations": [...],
    99	    "recent_context": [...],

    52	## A Note from Milla & Ben — April 7, 2026
    53	
    54	> The community caught real problems in this README within hours of launch and we want to address them directly.
    55	>
    56	> **What we got wrong:**
    57	>
    58	> - **The AAAK token example was incorrect.** We used a rough heuristic (`len(text)//3`) for token counts instead of an actual tokenizer. Real counts via OpenAI's tokenizer: the English example is 66 tokens, the AAAK example is 73. AAAK does not save tokens at small scales — it's designed for *repeated entities at scale*, and the README example was a bad demonstration of that. We're rewriting it.
    59	>
    60	> - **"30x lossless compression" was overstated.** AAAK is a lossy abbreviation system (entity codes, sentence truncation). Independent benchmarks show AAAK mode scores **84.2% R@5 vs raw mode's 96.6%** on LongMemEval — a 12.4 point regression. The honest framing is: AAAK is an experimental compression layer that trades fidelity for token density, and **the 96.6% headline number is from RAW mode, not AAAK**.
    61	>
    62	> - **"+34% palace boost" was misleading.** That number compares unfiltered search to wing+room metadata filtering. Metadata filtering is a standard ChromaDB feature, not a novel retrieval mechanism. Real and useful, but not a moat.
    63	>
    64	> - **"Contradiction detection"** exists as a separate utility (`fact_checker.py`) but is not currently wired into the knowledge graph operations as the README implied.
    65	>
    66	> - **"100% with Haiku rerank"** is real (we have the result files) but the rerank pipeline is not in the public benchmark scripts. We're adding it.
    67	>
    68	> **What's still true and reproducible:**
    69	>
    70	> - **96.6% R@5 on LongMemEval in raw mode**, on 500 questions, zero API calls — independently reproduced on M2 Ultra in under 5 minutes by [@gizmax](https://github.com/milla-jovovich/mempalace/issues/39).
    71	> - Local, free, no subscription, no cloud, no data leaving your machine.
    72	> - The architecture (wings, rooms, closets, drawers) is real and useful, even if it's not a magical retrieval boost.
    73	>
    74	> **What we're doing:**
    75	>
    76	> 1. Rewriting the AAAK example with real tokenizer counts and a scenario where AAAK actually demonstrates compression
    77	> 2. Adding `mode raw / aaak / rooms` clearly to the benchmark documentation so the trade-offs are visible
    78	> 3. Wiring `fact_checker.py` into the KG ops so the contradiction detection claim becomes true
    79	> 4. Pinning ChromaDB to a tested range (Issue #100), fixing the shell injection in hooks (#110), and addressing the macOS ARM64 segfault (#74)
    80	>

32:| **Hybrid v4 + Sonnet rerank** | **100%** | Sonnet (optional) | ~$0.003 |
36:The 100% is the competitive story: a perfect score on the standard benchmark for AI memory, verified across all 500 questions and all 6 question types — reproducible with either Haiku or Sonnet as the reranker.
46:| 1 | **MemPal (hybrid v4 + rerank)** | **100%** | Optional | Haiku | Reproducible, 500/500 |
48:| 3 | MemPal (hybrid v3 + rerank) | 99.4% | Optional | Haiku | Reproducible |
49:| 3 | MemPal (palace + rerank) | 99.4% | Optional | Haiku | Independent architecture |
51:| 5 | **MemPal (raw, no LLM)** | **96.6%** | **None** | **None** | **Highest zero-API score published** |
58:**MemPal raw (96.6%) is the highest published LongMemEval score that requires no API key, no cloud, and no LLM at any stage.**
60:**MemPal hybrid v4 + Haiku rerank (100%) is the first perfect score on LongMemEval — 500/500 questions, all 6 question types at 100%.**
75:MemPal is more than 2× Mem0 on this benchmark. With Sonnet rerank, MemPal reaches **100% on LoCoMo** across all 5 question types including temporal-inference (was 46% at baseline).
93:| **Hybrid v5 + Sonnet rerank (top-50)** | **100%** | **100%** | Sonnet | Structurally guaranteed (top-k > sessions) |
94:| **bge-large + Haiku rerank (top-15)** | — | **96.3%** | Haiku | Single-hop 86.6%, temporal-inf 87.0% |
99:| **Palace v2 (top-10, 3 rooms)** | 75.6% | **84.8%** | Haiku (index) | Room assignment at index; summary routing at query |
100:| Wings v1 (broken — filter not boost) | — | 58.0% | None | Speaker WHERE filter discarded evidence; 5.4% coverage |
102:| Session, no rerank (top-10) | — | 60.3% | None | Baseline |
103:| Dialog, no rerank (top-10) | — | 48.0% | None | — |
127:Root cause of wings v1 failure: (1) speaker WHERE filter discarded evidence about Caroline when evidence lived in a John-tagged closet (John spoke more words but conversation was about Caroline); (2) top_k=10 from ~184 closets = 5.4% coverage vs 37% in session mode. Fix: retrieve all closets, use speaker match as 15% distance boost instead of filter.
129:**With Sonnet rerank, MemPal achieves 100% on every LoCoMo question type — including temporal-inference, which was the hardest category at baseline.**
131:**Per-category breakdown (hybrid + Sonnet rerank):**
141:**Temporal-inference was the hardest category** — questions requiring connections across multiple sessions. Hybrid scoring (person name boost, quoted phrase boost) combined with Sonnet's reading comprehension closes this gap entirely. From 46% to 100%.
174:This was the first result. Nobody expected it to work this well. The team's hypothesis was that raw verbatim storage would lose to systems that extract structured facts. The 96.6% proved the hypothesis wrong.
190:When query keywords appear verbatim in a session, that session gets a small boost. The boost is mild enough not to hurt recall when keywords don't match.
200:**What changed:** Added temporal boost — sessions near the question's reference date get a distance reduction (up to 40%).
203:# Sessions near question_date - offset get score boost
205:    fused_dist *= (1.0 - temporal_boost * proximity_factor)
208:**Why it worked:** Many LongMemEval questions are anchored to a specific time ("what did you do last month?"). Multiple sessions might semantically match, but only one is temporally correct. The boost breaks ties in favor of the right time period.
246:**Fix 2 — Person name boosting** (miss: `Rachel/ukulele` temporal question):
252:**Result:** All 6 question types at 100% R@5. 500/500 questions. No regressions.
254:**Haiku vs. Sonnet rerank:** Both achieve 100% R@5. NDCG@10 is 0.976 (Haiku) vs 0.975 (Sonnet) — statistically identical. Haiku is ~3× cheaper. Sonnet is slightly faster at this task (2.99s/q vs 3.85s/q in our run). Either works; Haiku is the default recommendation.

423:| **MemPal** | Raw verbatim text + ChromaDB | 96.6% / 100% | Python + ChromaDB | Open source — 100% LME + 100% LoCoMo w/ rerank |
453:The 96.6% raw baseline is fully clean. No heuristics were tuned on the test set. Store verbatim text, query with ChromaDB's default embeddings, score. Exactly reproducible.
455:The hybrid v4 improvements (quoted phrase boost, person name boost, nostalgia patterns) were developed by directly examining the three specific questions that failed in every prior mode:
458:- `4dfccbf8` — Rachel/ukulele temporal question → fix: person name boost
498:The LoCoMo 100% result with top-k=50 has a structural issue: each of the 10 conversations has 19–32 sessions, but top-k=50 exceeds that count. This means the ground-truth session is always in the candidate pool regardless of the embedding model's ranking. The Sonnet rerank is essentially doing reading comprehension over all sessions — the embedding retrieval step is bypassed entirely.
500:**The honest LoCoMo score is the top-10 result: 60.3% without rerank.** A re-run at top-k=10 with the hybrid mode and rerank is the next step for a publishable LoCoMo result.
514:**The LLM rerank is optional, not required.** The 96.6% baseline needs no API key at any stage — not for indexing, not for retrieval, not for scoring. The 99.4% result adds an optional Haiku rerank step that costs approximately $0.001 per question. This is standard practice: Supermemory ASMR, Mastra, and Hindsight all use LLMs in their retrieval pipelines.

556:### LongMemEval held-out 450 — hybrid_v4 (no rerank, clean score)
560:This is the honest publishable number. hybrid_v4's fixes (quoted phrase boost, person name boost, nostalgia patterns) were developed by examining 3 questions from the full 500. The held-out 450 were never seen during development.
583:### LoCoMo hybrid_v5 — honest top-10 (no rerank)
587:The v5 fix: extracted person names from keyword overlap scoring. In LoCoMo, both speakers' names appear in every session — including them in keyword boosting gave equal signal to all sessions. Removing them lets predicate keywords ("research", "career") do the actual work.
598:Beats Memori (81.95%) by 7pp with no reranking. Result file: `results_locomo_hybrid_session_top10_*.json`
604:**Architecture v1 (global taxonomy routing):** Haiku assigns each session to a room at index time. At query time, Haiku routes question to 1-2 rooms. **Result: 34.2% R@5** — 62.5% zero-recall. Failure: independent LLM calls with no shared context produced terminology mismatch between index-time labels and query-time routing.
606:**Architecture v2 (conversation-specific routing):** Same room assignments at index time. At query time, route using keyword overlap against per-room aggregated session summaries — the *same text* used to generate the labels. No LLM calls at query time. **Result: 84.8% R@10 (3 rooms), 75.6% R@5.**
611:| v2: summary-based routing, top-2 rooms | 71.7% | 77.9% | 17.8% | Big fix |

I’ve got enough evidence to separate product story from implementation now. The last pass is tightening the comparison against Public’s current memory surfaces and checking a couple of prior memory notes so I can keep this iteration additive rather than rehashing earlier findings.

   365	## User preferences
   366	
   367	- when the user asked to "create a similar prompt for ...005-mempalace ... dont ask for a spec folder," place `phase-research-prompt.md` in the phase root and skip new spec-folder scaffolding [Task 1]
   368	- when the user asked "Run /spec_kit:deep-research ... get tot 20 total iterations so add 7 more," treat it as resume of the active lineage, not a fork [Task 2]
   369	- when asked to fold the extension into active v2 synthesis "without changing the overall verdict or top-10 ordering," integrate new evidence/counts without re-ranking master recommendations [Task 2]
   370	- when folding closeouts into the root, the user insisted to "leave v1 files untouched" and only update active `research-v2` artifacts [Task 4]
   371	- after strict validation surfaced low-quality resume artifacts, the user said “do manually rewrite or adjust memories if you deemed quality low” -> manually repair latest `memory/*.md` snapshots when stale “Continue implementation” / `IN_PROGRESS` cues no longer match packet reality [Task 5]
   372	- when the user asked to “update ... in place so it aligns with the current canonical research ... including sequencing, prerequisites, and acceptance criteria,” re-anchor packet docs to the latest master synthesis instead of older phase framing [Task 6]
   373	- once the user replies “Approved” to a gap diagnosis, proceed directly with packet doc + validation edits without re-asking for execution permission [Task 6]
   374	- when closing packet work, the user expectation was explicit completion proof (`validate.sh --strict` + `check-completion.sh`) plus memory-index refresh before claiming done [Task 7]
   375	- when the user asked to “analyze research... suggest spec phases” and then “Implement the plan,” map recommendations into concrete follow-on Level-3 phase folders in the existing train and finish with validator-clean status before runtime work [Task 8]
   376	
   377	## Reusable knowledge
   378	
   379	- prompt authoring pattern for this packet family: keep the 13-section TIDD-EC structure, include ordered evidence reading, and force evidence tags (`source-confirmed`, `README-documented`, `benchmark-documented`) per finding [Task 1]
   380	- MemPalace-specific guardrails that proved useful: AAAK remains experimental/lossy, raw ChromaDB verbatim posture is baseline, and benchmark/README claims need code-backed verification before adoption [Task 1]
   381	- deep-research extension runbook: align `maxIterations` in config/state/strategy first, keep lineage/execution mode unchanged, run reducer after each iteration (`node .opencode/skill/sk-deep-research/scripts/reduce-state.cjs {spec_folder}`), then refresh synthesis/registry/dashboard artifacts [Task 2]
   382	- closeout integration for this packet should update `research-v2.md`, `recommendations-v2.md`, `findings-registry-v2.json`, and `deep-research-dashboard.md` while leaving historical `research/research.md` snapshot content intact [Task 2][Task 4]
   383	- Claudest continuation is now an execution-ready sequence to preserve in order: FTS helper and forced-degrade tests -> stop-hook metadata patch -> normalized analytics reader -> cached-summary fast path -> verifier/discoverer split -> token-insight contracts [Task 3]
   384	- Graphify closeout guidance is additive rather than replacement: enrich existing payload confidence/provenance and layered runtime hints (`session-prime`, `compact-inject`, `response-hints`), keep low-level invalidation as already covered by Public indexing, and defer clustering metadata to a later phase [Task 4]
   385	- memory cleanup rule in this packet family: edit only the active/latest snapshot per packet (root + child `memory/*.md`) to mark completion truthfully, switch status to COMPLETE/100%, set `Next Action` to reference-only, and record manual refinement date when user approves direct fixes [Task 5]
   386	- stale resume cue scan that worked: `rg -n "Continue implementation|IN_PROGRESS|quality score: 0/100|PASS-WITH-CAVEATS" memory/*.md`, patch matches, then rerun recursive strict validation on the parent packet [Task 5]
   387	- for `decision-record.md` template conformance, removing only non-template `<!-- ANCHOR:adr-* -->` comment lines preserves ADR content while clearing `ANCHORS_VALID` strict warnings [Task 5]
   388	- canonical source for `002-implement-cache-warning-hooks` updates is the post-2026-04-08 synthesis in `001-research-graph-context-systems/research.md` and `research/recommendations.md`; align ordering/prereqs/acceptance there and keep task wording consistent about `.claude/settings.local.json` boundaries [Task 6]
   389	- phase sequence now expected in `002` docs: shared schema/metadata -> replay harness -> stop timestamp -> seam validation -> resume estimator -> UserPromptSubmit gate, with producer metadata + cache token carry-forward + bootstrap authority kept as acceptance anchors [Task 6]
   390	- `031-normalized-analytics-reader` closeout runbook: mark `spec.md` status `Complete`, align checklist P0/P1 totals to actual counts, refresh `description.json` timestamp/description, then run strict validation plus completion checks before closure [Task 7]
   391	- if memory indexing flags lineage/template mismatches during closeout, remove stale rows with `memory_delete`, rerun forced `memory_index_scan` after cooldown, and verify clean reindex before final sign-off [Task 7]
   392	- follow-on phase train now implemented as: `026/005` measurement contract -> `026/006` trust-axis contract -> `026/007` detector floor -> `026/008` graph hint nudge -> `026/009` auditable publication -> `024/032` cached-summary consumer -> `024/033` optional FTS hardening -> `024/034` workflow/token-insight split [Task 8]
   393	- for newly created child packets, keep full Level 3 artifacts (`spec/plan/tasks/checklist/decision-record/implementation-summary/description`), remove README scaffolds, run strict validation per child, then validate parent with `--no-recursive` to confirm phase-link and parent metadata wiring [Task 8]
   394	
   395	## Failures and how to do differently
   396	
   397	- symptom: strict validation step in prompt cannot run; cause: phase lacks Level 3 docs (`spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`, `checklist.md`, `decision-record.md`); fix: create/verify those docs before running `validate.sh --strict` or deep research loops [Task 1]
   398	- symptom: strict validation shows `ANCHORS_VALID` warnings in `decision-record.md`; cause: extra non-template `adr-*` anchor comment lines; fix: remove only the extra comment anchors (not the ADR sections), then rerun recursive `validate.sh --strict` to confirm 0 errors/0 warnings [Task 5]
   399	- symptom: large multi-file memory patch fails to apply cleanly; cause: generated memory snapshots drift from expected formatting; fix: use smaller per-file patches on the latest packet snapshots and revalidate after each batch [Task 5]
   400	- symptom: closeout validation passes but memory index reports lineage mismatch/stale packet rows; cause: old memory_index entries persisted through packet updates; fix: delete stale row IDs, wait out cooldown, then force `memory_index_scan` and confirm zero failed entries before marking complete [Task 7]
   401	- symptom: new phase packets fail strict checks with `AI_PROTOCOL`, `SECTION_COUNTS`, or `SPEC_DOC_INTEGRITY`; cause: scaffold docs left template-thin (missing AI Execution Protocol blocks, acceptance scenarios, anchors) or README placeholders were kept; fix: fill Level 3 templates immediately and delete scaffold READMEs before rerunning strict validation [Task 8]

I already have the concrete file evidence, but I’m making one semantic pass as well so this iteration still honors the repo’s “explore unfamiliar code with CocoIndex first” preference where possible. If it fails again, I’ll keep relying on the direct reads I’ve already completed.

# Iteration 018: RISK ASSESSMENT

## Focus
RISK ASSESSMENT: What are the risks of adopting each recommended pattern? What could go wrong?

## Findings
### Finding 1: Hook-driven preservation can create blocking saves without proof that good data was actually preserved
- **Source**: [mempal_save_hook.sh](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/hooks/mempal_save_hook.sh#L129); [mempal_precompact_hook.sh](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/hooks/mempal_precompact_hook.sh#L64); [mcp_server.py](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/mcp_server.py#L326); [generate-context.js](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/dist/memory/generate-context.js#L85); [spec-kit-compact-code-graph.js](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/plugins/spec-kit-compact-code-graph.js#L396)
- **What it does**: MemPalace blocks every 15 user turns and always blocks before compaction, then tells the AI to save; optional auto-ingest is backgrounded in the stop hook and synchronous only if `MEMPAL_DIR` is configured. The write path itself is weakly protected: `mempalace_add_drawer` uses deterministic IDs, but it does not actually call the semantic duplicate checker before writing.
- **Why it matters for us**: If we copy this pattern into Public, the biggest failure mode is a false sense of safety: the runtime is interrupted, but preservation quality still depends on the model following instructions correctly. That can yield duplicated memories, noisy categorization, partial saves, or blocked UX with no durable improvement. Public’s current compaction transport and JSON-primary `generate-context.js` path are much more deterministic.
- **Recommendation**: prototype later
- **Impact**: high

### Finding 2: A thin wake-up digest is reusable, but MemPalace’s actual L1 ranking is too naive to trust as a primary bootstrap
- **Source**: [layers.py](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/layers.py#L76); [layers.py](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/layers.py#L124); [layers.py](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/layers.py#L389); [context-server.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/context-server.ts#L764); [memory-search.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/handlers/memory-search.ts#L482)
- **What it does**: L0 is a static `identity.txt`; L1 loads every drawer, scores by a few metadata keys, sorts by importance only, takes the top 15, groups by room, and truncates snippets to fit a char cap. Despite comments about “most-recent,” there is no real recency or authority model in the ranking.
- **Why it matters for us**: A Public-native startup digest could still be useful, but adopting MemPalace’s ranking logic directly would privilege stale but highly weighted memories, flatten provenance, and compete with stronger existing recovery paths like `session_bootstrap`, `session_resume`, and `memory_context(resume)`. The risk is not just mediocre recall; it is confidently front-loading the wrong context.
- **Recommendation**: prototype later
- **Impact**: medium

### Finding 3: Status-as-protocol-bootstrap is the lowest-risk transfer, but only if we keep it much smaller than MemPalace does
- **Source**: [mcp_server.py](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/mcp_server.py#L139); [mcp_server.py](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/mcp_server.py#L169); [context-server.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/context-server.ts#L738); [context-server.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/context-server.ts#L782)
- **What it does**: `mempalace_status` returns palace counts plus a full `PALACE_PROTOCOL` and `AAAK_SPEC`, explicitly teaching the agent when to query, when to diary-write, and when to invalidate facts. Public already has startup guidance, recovery hints, and tool routing, but its own code explicitly notes those instructions are computed once at startup and not refreshed mid-session.
- **Why it matters for us**: The reusable idea is strong: one surface can teach memory behavior, not just expose health. The risk is that a MemPalace-sized protocol blob would become stale, conflict with Public’s existing bootstrap authority, and add prompt noise faster than it adds reliability. The safe version is a short, stable rule set, not a second operating manual.
- **Recommendation**: adopt now
- **Impact**: medium

### Finding 4: A separate temporal fact plane is high-upside, but MemPalace’s current source contract is too loose for Public
- **Source**: [knowledge_graph.py](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/knowledge_graph.py#L56); [knowledge_graph.py](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/knowledge_graph.py#L121); [knowledge_graph.py](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/knowledge_graph.py#L180); [mcp_server.py](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/mcp_server.py#L422); [README.md](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/README.md#L64)
- **What it does**: MemPalace keeps `entities` and `triples` in SQLite with `valid_from`/`valid_to`, separate from Chroma drawers. That split is real. But `kg_add` does not require source evidence, contradiction detection is not actually wired into KG ops, and `invalidate` updates all matching live triples with no stronger review step.
- **Why it matters for us**: This is the one new architecture that Public genuinely lacks. The risk is governance, not mechanics: uncited fact insertion, ambiguous invalidation, silent drift between fact rows and verbatim memory, and agent-written “truth” that outruns its evidence. If we build this, it needs mandatory citations, authority tiers, correction workflows, and separation from ordinary memory writes.
- **Recommendation**: NEW FEATURE
- **Impact**: high

### Finding 5: Full palace taxonomy remains the easiest pattern to overpay for and the hardest to keep honest
- **Source**: [room_detector_local.py](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/room_detector_local.py#L18); [miner.py](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/miner.py#L278); [palace_graph.py](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/palace_graph.py#L33); [README.md](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/README.md#L62); [BENCHMARKS.md](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/benchmarks/BENCHMARKS.md#L604)
- **What it does**: Room assignment is driven by folder-name maps, filename/path matches, and keyword counts; the palace graph is then derived from shared `wing`/`room`/`hall` metadata. The repo’s own correction note says the famous “palace boost” was mostly metadata filtering, and benchmark notes show roomed routing still trailing the stronger hybrid no-rooms baseline.
- **Why it matters for us**: If Public adopted this whole taxonomy, we would be buying label governance, reindex churn, room drift, fuzzy routing mistakes, and operator overhead for a capability that mostly repackages filtering we already have via scope, context types, and graph/search tools. The main thing that could go wrong is spending real product complexity on a memorable metaphor that does not improve truthfulness or recovery enough to justify itself.
- **Recommendation**: reject
- **Impact**: low

## Assessment
- New information ratio: 0.83
- Questions addressed: hook timing reliability; duplicate/write-path risk; wake-up digest staleness; bootstrap instruction drift; temporal KG authority; taxonomy governance cost
- Questions answered: the safest near-term transfer is a very short bootstrap/status guidance layer; hook-enforced preservation is promising but operationally risky; the temporal fact plane is valuable only with a much stricter evidence contract; full palace taxonomy still should not be ported

## Reflection
- What worked: reading the hook scripts, write tools, and Public bootstrap/compaction code side by side exposed the real failure modes much faster than README-level comparison
- What did not work: the phase folder is still missing the expected Level 3 docs, `validate.sh --strict` emitted `cannot create temp file for here document: Operation not permitted` while still reporting `RESULT: PASSED`, and CocoIndex MCP calls were cancelled in this session, so I treated direct file reads as the trustworthy evidence source

## Recommended Next Focus
Prototype the narrowest viable Public experiment: add a short, stable memory-behavior hint block to bootstrap/status output, and test one compaction-time preservation checkpoint that writes only JSON-primary evidence through `generate-context.js` without adopting MemPalace’s blocking auto-save loop or full taxonomy.

# Iteration 018: RISK ASSESSMENT

## Focus
RISK ASSESSMENT: What are the risks of adopting each recommended pattern? What could go wrong?

## Findings
### Finding 1: Hook-driven preservation can create blocking saves without proof that good data was actually preserved
- **Source**: [mempal_save_hook.sh](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/hooks/mempal_save_hook.sh#L129); [mempal_precompact_hook.sh](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/hooks/mempal_precompact_hook.sh#L64); [mcp_server.py](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/mcp_server.py#L326); [generate-context.js](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/dist/memory/generate-context.js#L85); [spec-kit-compact-code-graph.js](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/plugins/spec-kit-compact-code-graph.js#L396)
- **What it does**: MemPalace blocks every 15 user turns and always blocks before compaction, then tells the AI to save; optional auto-ingest is backgrounded in the stop hook and synchronous only if `MEMPAL_DIR` is configured. The write path itself is weakly protected: `mempalace_add_drawer` uses deterministic IDs, but it does not actually call the semantic duplicate checker before writing.
- **Why it matters for us**: If we copy this pattern into Public, the biggest failure mode is a false sense of safety: the runtime is interrupted, but preservation quality still depends on the model following instructions correctly. That can yield duplicated memories, noisy categorization, partial saves, or blocked UX with no durable improvement. Public’s current compaction transport and JSON-primary `generate-context.js` path are much more deterministic.
- **Recommendation**: prototype later
- **Impact**: high

### Finding 2: A thin wake-up digest is reusable, but MemPalace’s actual L1 ranking is too naive to trust as a primary bootstrap
- **Source**: [layers.py](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/layers.py#L76); [layers.py](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/layers.py#L124); [layers.py](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/layers.py#L389); [context-server.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/context-server.ts#L764); [memory-search.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/handlers/memory-search.ts#L482)
- **What it does**: L0 is a static `identity.txt`; L1 loads every drawer, scores by a few metadata keys, sorts by importance only, takes the top 15, groups by room, and truncates snippets to fit a char cap. Despite comments about “most-recent,” there is no real recency or authority model in the ranking.
- **Why it matters for us**: A Public-native startup digest could still be useful, but adopting MemPalace’s ranking logic directly would privilege stale but highly weighted memories, flatten provenance, and compete with stronger existing recovery paths like `session_bootstrap`, `session_resume`, and `memory_context(resume)`. The risk is not just mediocre recall; it is confidently front-loading the wrong context.
- **Recommendation**: prototype later
- **Impact**: medium

### Finding 3: Status-as-protocol-bootstrap is the lowest-risk transfer, but only if we keep it much smaller than MemPalace does
- **Source**: [mcp_server.py](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/mcp_server.py#L139); [mcp_server.py](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/mcp_server.py#L169); [context-server.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/context-server.ts#L738); [context-server.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/context-server.ts#L782)
- **What it does**: `mempalace_status` returns palace counts plus a full `PALACE_PROTOCOL` and `AAAK_SPEC`, explicitly teaching the agent when to query, when to diary-write, and when to invalidate facts. Public already has startup guidance, recovery hints, and tool routing, but its own code explicitly notes those instructions are computed once at startup and not refreshed mid-session.
- **Why it matters for us**: The reusable idea is strong: one surface can teach memory behavior, not just expose health. The risk is that a MemPalace-sized protocol blob would become stale, conflict with Public’s existing bootstrap authority, and add prompt noise faster than it adds reliability. The safe version is a short, stable rule set, not a second operating manual.
- **Recommendation**: adopt now
- **Impact**: medium

### Finding 4: A separate temporal fact plane is high-upside, but MemPalace’s current source contract is too loose for Public
- **Source**: [knowledge_graph.py](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/knowledge_graph.py#L56); [knowledge_graph.py](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/knowledge_graph.py#L121); [knowledge_graph.py](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/knowledge_graph.py#L180); [mcp_server.py](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/mcp_server.py#L422); [README.md](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/README.md#L64)
- **What it does**: MemPalace keeps `entities` and `triples` in SQLite with `valid_from`/`valid_to`, separate from Chroma drawers. That split is real. But `kg_add` does not require source evidence, contradiction detection is not actually wired into KG ops, and `invalidate` updates all matching live triples with no stronger review step.
- **Why it matters for us**: This is the one new architecture that Public genuinely lacks. The risk is governance, not mechanics: uncited fact insertion, ambiguous invalidation, silent drift between fact rows and verbatim memory, and agent-written “truth” that outruns its evidence. If we build this, it needs mandatory citations, authority tiers, correction workflows, and separation from ordinary memory writes.
- **Recommendation**: NEW FEATURE
- **Impact**: high

### Finding 5: Full palace taxonomy remains the easiest pattern to overpay for and the hardest to keep honest
- **Source**: [room_detector_local.py](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/room_detector_local.py#L18); [miner.py](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/miner.py#L278); [palace_graph.py](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/mempalace/palace_graph.py#L33); [README.md](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/README.md#L62); [BENCHMARKS.md](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/external/benchmarks/BENCHMARKS.md#L604)
- **What it does**: Room assignment is driven by folder-name maps, filename/path matches, and keyword counts; the palace graph is then derived from shared `wing`/`room`/`hall` metadata. The repo’s own correction note says the famous “palace boost” was mostly metadata filtering, and benchmark notes show roomed routing still trailing the stronger hybrid no-rooms baseline.
- **Why it matters for us**: If Public adopted this whole taxonomy, we would be buying label governance, reindex churn, room drift, fuzzy routing mistakes, and operator overhead for a capability that mostly repackages filtering we already have via scope, context types, and graph/search tools. The main thing that could go wrong is spending real product complexity on a memorable metaphor that does not improve truthfulness or recovery enough to justify itself.
- **Recommendation**: reject
- **Impact**: low
