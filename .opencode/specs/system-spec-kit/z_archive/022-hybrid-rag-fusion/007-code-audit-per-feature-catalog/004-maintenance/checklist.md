# Verification Checklist: Code Audit — Maintenance

<!-- SPECKIT_LEVEL: 2 -->
<!-- SPECKIT_TEMPLATE_SOURCE: checklist | v2.2 -->

<!-- ANCHOR:protocol -->
## Verification Protocol

| Priority | Handling | Completion Impact |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| **[P0]** | HARD BLOCKER | Cannot claim done until complete |
| **[P1]** | Required | Must complete OR get user approval |
| **[P2]** | Optional | Can defer with documented reason |

<!-- ANCHOR:pre-impl -->
## Pre-Implementation

- [x] CHK-001 [P0] Feature catalog files accessible and current — `feature_catalog/04--maintenance/` confirmed; 2 features present [EVIDENCE: 2026-03-25 release-alignment normalization cross-checked spec.md, plan.md, and implementation-summary.md.]
- [x] CHK-002 [P0] Source code accessible — `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/` accessible; all referenced files located [EVIDENCE: 2026-03-25 release-alignment normalization cross-checked spec.md, plan.md, and implementation-summary.md.]
- [x] CHK-003 [P1] Audit methodology documented in plan.md — Read→Locate→Compare→Document pattern recorded in plan.md §3 [EVIDENCE: 2026-03-25 release-alignment normalization cross-checked spec.md, plan.md, and implementation-summary.md.]

<!-- /ANCHOR:pre-impl -->

<!-- ANCHOR:code-quality -->
## Code Quality

- [x] CHK-010 [P0] All 2 features audited individually — F01 (memory_index_scan): PARTIAL; F02 (startup guards): MATCH [EVIDENCE: 2026-03-25 release-alignment normalization cross-checked spec.md, plan.md, and implementation-summary.md.]
- [x] CHK-011 [P0] Each feature cross-referenced with source code — 131+78 files (F01), 3+3 files (F02) all confirmed [EVIDENCE: 2026-03-25 release-alignment normalization cross-checked spec.md, plan.md, and implementation-summary.md.]
- [x] CHK-012 [P1] Discrepancies documented with evidence — F01 gap: `history.ts` absent from source list; `BATCH_SIZE` origin untraced. Recorded in spec.md §13. [EVIDENCE: 2026-03-25 release-alignment normalization cross-checked spec.md, plan.md, and implementation-summary.md.]
- [x] CHK-013 [P1] Source file references verified to exist — All referenced source + test files confirmed present on disk [EVIDENCE: 2026-03-25 release-alignment normalization cross-checked spec.md, plan.md, and implementation-summary.md.]
- [x] CHK-014 [P2] Feature interaction dependencies noted — `history.ts` direct import dependency identified for F01 [EVIDENCE: 2026-03-25 release-alignment normalization cross-checked spec.md, plan.md, and implementation-summary.md.]

<!-- ANCHOR:testing -->
## Testing

- [x] CHK-020 [P0] Zero features skipped without documented reason — Both features audited; none skipped [EVIDENCE: 2026-03-25 release-alignment normalization cross-checked spec.md, plan.md, and implementation-summary.md.]
- [x] CHK-021 [P0] All findings categorized (match/mismatch/gap) — F01: PARTIAL (gap: missing source file ref); F02: MATCH [EVIDENCE: 2026-03-25 release-alignment normalization cross-checked spec.md, plan.md, and implementation-summary.md.]
- [x] CHK-022 [P1] Summary statistics compiled — 1 MATCH, 1 PARTIAL; see spec.md §13 summary table [EVIDENCE: 2026-03-25 release-alignment normalization cross-checked spec.md, plan.md, and implementation-summary.md.]
- [x] CHK-023 [P2] Recommendations for catalog updates documented — F01: add `history.ts` to source list; annotate `BATCH_SIZE` as local constant [EVIDENCE: 2026-03-25 release-alignment normalization cross-checked spec.md, plan.md, and implementation-summary.md.]

<!-- ANCHOR:security -->
## Security

- [x] CHK-030 [P0] No secrets were introduced in this audit packet [EVIDENCE: this packet documents read-only audit results and contains no credentials or secret material]
- [x] CHK-031 [P0] The audit packet does not change runtime behavior [EVIDENCE: the packet records findings only and does not ship runtime code]
- [x] CHK-032 [P1] Repository references stay within the expected project scope [EVIDENCE: the documented audit inputs and outputs remain within the spec tree and implementation repository]

<!-- /ANCHOR:security -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:docs -->
## Documentation


- [x] CHK-040 [P1] spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md synchronized — All 4 docs updated 2026-03-22; status=Complete across all [EVIDENCE: 2026-03-25 release-alignment normalization cross-checked spec.md, plan.md, and implementation-summary.md.]
- [x] CHK-041 [P1] Findings written in clear, actionable language — MATCH/PARTIAL verdicts with specific file names and action items [EVIDENCE: 2026-03-25 release-alignment normalization cross-checked spec.md, plan.md, and implementation-summary.md.]
- [x] CHK-042 [P2] Cross-references to other phase audits noted — Parent catalog at `007-code-audit-per-feature-catalog/` is the cross-phase reference point [EVIDENCE: 2026-03-25 release-alignment normalization cross-checked spec.md, plan.md, and implementation-summary.md.]

<!-- ANCHOR:file-org -->
## File Organization

- [x] CHK-050 [P1] Temp files in scratch/ only — No temp files created during this audit [EVIDENCE: 2026-03-25 release-alignment normalization cross-checked spec.md, plan.md, and implementation-summary.md.]
- [x] CHK-051 [P1] scratch/ cleaned before completion — scratch/ is empty; no cleanup needed [EVIDENCE: 2026-03-25 release-alignment normalization cross-checked spec.md, plan.md, and implementation-summary.md.]
- [x] CHK-052 [P2] Key findings saved to memory/ — Deferred to orchestrator; memory save via generate-context.js if required [EVIDENCE: 2026-03-25 release-alignment normalization cross-checked spec.md, plan.md, and implementation-summary.md.]

### Architecture Verification

- [x] CHK-100 [P1] Feature-to-source traceability matrix complete — F01: 131 impl + 78 test files; F02: 3 impl + 3 test files; all traced [EVIDENCE: 2026-03-25 release-alignment normalization cross-checked spec.md, plan.md, and implementation-summary.md.]
- [x] CHK-101 [P1] All source file paths verified — All paths confirmed on disk; `history.ts` identified as undocumented direct dependency for F01 [EVIDENCE: 2026-03-25 release-alignment normalization cross-checked spec.md, plan.md, and implementation-summary.md.]
- [x] CHK-102 [P2] Cross-category dependencies documented — F01 imports `history.ts` (Retrieval category boundary); noted in findings [EVIDENCE: 2026-03-25 release-alignment normalization cross-checked spec.md, plan.md, and implementation-summary.md.]
