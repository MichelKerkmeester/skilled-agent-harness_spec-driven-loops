# Implementation Summary

<!-- SPECKIT_LEVEL: 1 -->
<!-- SPECKIT_TEMPLATE_SOURCE: impl-summary-core | v2.2 -->
<!-- HVR_REFERENCE: .opencode/skills/sk-doc/references/hvr_rules.md -->

## Metadata

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Spec Folder** | 028-mcp-to-cli-tool-transition/003-skill-advisor-cli/003-runtime-integration |
| **Completed** | Not yet — planned |
| **Level** | 1 |

<!-- ANCHOR:what-built -->
## What Was Built

Nothing yet — this phase is scaffolded in planned state. Binding scope artifacts: `spec.md` (requirements + acceptance criteria), `tasks.md` (planned rows), and the research authority `../000-skill-advisor-cli-research/research/research.md` (delta specs and measurements). The intended outcome: Pairing per program rule: prompt-submit advisor-brief hooks (Claude/Codex/Devin) gain the CLI warm path under the <60ms cache-hit p95 bar (D4), mk-skill-advisor plugin bridge gains CLI fallback, config compatibility (D7), doctor routes, docs

### Files Changed

| File | Action | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| None yet | — | Phase not started |

<!-- ANCHOR:how-delivered -->
## How It Was Delivered

Not delivered yet. Delivery follows the speckit:plan pass for this phase; estimated effort ~1 packet (small-medium).
<!-- /ANCHOR:how-delivered -->

<!-- ANCHOR:decisions -->
## Key Decisions

| Decision | Why |
|----------|-----|
| Scope inherited verbatim from the research record + program pairing rule | The research terminally classified the risks; the pairing rule is operator-directed program scope |
<!-- /ANCHOR:decisions -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:verification -->
## Verification

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Structural (runs now) | `bash .opencode/skills/system-spec-kit/scripts/spec/validate.sh <this-folder> --strict` |
| Phase verification (planned) | Transport-down drill passes in ≥2 runtimes within budget; plugin fallback works; docs published |
<!-- /ANCHOR:verification -->

<!-- ANCHOR:limitations -->
## Known Limitations

1. **Planned state.** This document is a stub by design; it gains real content when the phase ships.
