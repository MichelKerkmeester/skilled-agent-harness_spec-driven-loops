# Verification Checklist: Code Audit — Evaluation

<!-- SPECKIT_LEVEL: 2 -->
<!-- SPECKIT_TEMPLATE_SOURCE: checklist | v2.2 -->

<!-- ANCHOR:protocol -->
## Verification Protocol

| Priority | Handling | Completion Impact |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| **[P0]** | HARD BLOCKER | Cannot claim done until complete |
| **[P1]** | Required | Must complete OR get user approval |
| **[P2]** | Optional | Can defer with documented reason |

<!-- ANCHOR:pre-impl -->
## Pre-Implementation

- [x] CHK-001 [P0] Feature catalog files accessible and current — `feature_catalog/07--evaluation/` confirmed accessible with 2 entries [EVIDENCE: 2026-03-25 release-alignment normalization cross-checked spec.md, plan.md, and implementation-summary.md.]
- [x] CHK-002 [P0] Source code accessible — MCP server source confirmed readable [EVIDENCE: 2026-03-25 release-alignment normalization cross-checked spec.md, plan.md, and implementation-summary.md.]
- [x] CHK-003 [P1] Audit methodology documented in plan.md — plan.md Phase 1-3 structure in place [EVIDENCE: 2026-03-25 release-alignment normalization cross-checked spec.md, plan.md, and implementation-summary.md.]

<!-- /ANCHOR:pre-impl -->

<!-- ANCHOR:code-quality -->
## Code Quality

- [x] CHK-010 [P0] All 2 features audited individually — eval_run_ablation (PARTIAL) and eval_reporting_dashboard (MATCH) both audited [EVIDENCE: 2026-03-25 release-alignment normalization cross-checked spec.md, plan.md, and implementation-summary.md.]
- [x] CHK-011 [P0] Each feature cross-referenced with source code — behavioral descriptions traced to implementation for both features [EVIDENCE: 2026-03-25 release-alignment normalization cross-checked spec.md, plan.md, and implementation-summary.md.]
- [x] CHK-012 [P1] Discrepancies documented with evidence — F01 bloated source list (~90 vs ~15 relevant files) documented in spec.md §12 [EVIDENCE: 2026-03-25 release-alignment normalization cross-checked spec.md, plan.md, and implementation-summary.md.]
- [x] CHK-013 [P1] Source file references verified to exist — confirmed for both features; eval_reporting_dashboard properly scoped (8 impl + 2 test) [EVIDENCE: 2026-03-25 release-alignment normalization cross-checked spec.md, plan.md, and implementation-summary.md.]
- [x] CHK-014 [P2] Feature interaction dependencies noted — no cross-feature dependencies identified within this category [EVIDENCE: 2026-03-25 release-alignment normalization cross-checked spec.md, plan.md, and implementation-summary.md.]

<!-- ANCHOR:testing -->
## Testing

- [x] CHK-020 [P0] Zero features skipped without documented reason — both features covered [EVIDENCE: 2026-03-25 release-alignment normalization cross-checked spec.md, plan.md, and implementation-summary.md.]
- [x] CHK-021 [P0] All findings categorized (match/mismatch/gap) — F01: PARTIAL, F02: MATCH; recorded in spec.md §12 and plan.md FINDINGS SUMMARY [EVIDENCE: 2026-03-25 release-alignment normalization cross-checked spec.md, plan.md, and implementation-summary.md.]
- [x] CHK-022 [P1] Summary statistics compiled — 1 MATCH, 1 PARTIAL; recorded in plan.md FINDINGS SUMMARY [EVIDENCE: 2026-03-25 release-alignment normalization cross-checked spec.md, plan.md, and implementation-summary.md.]
- [x] CHK-023 [P2] Recommendations for catalog updates documented — trim eval_run_ablation source list to ~15 relevant files; noted in spec.md §13 [EVIDENCE: 2026-03-25 release-alignment normalization cross-checked spec.md, plan.md, and implementation-summary.md.]

<!-- ANCHOR:security -->
## Security

- [x] CHK-030 [P0] No secrets were introduced in this audit packet [EVIDENCE: this packet documents read-only audit results and contains no credentials or secret material]
- [x] CHK-031 [P0] The audit packet does not change runtime behavior [EVIDENCE: the packet records findings only and does not ship runtime code]
- [x] CHK-032 [P1] Repository references stay within the expected project scope [EVIDENCE: the documented audit inputs and outputs remain within the spec tree and implementation repository]

<!-- ANCHOR:docs -->
## Documentation


- [x] CHK-040 [P1] spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md synchronized — all 4 files updated to reflect Complete status with findings [EVIDENCE: 2026-03-25 release-alignment normalization cross-checked spec.md, plan.md, and implementation-summary.md.]
- [x] CHK-041 [P1] Findings written in clear, actionable language — PARTIAL verdict explains exact issue (source list size); MATCH verdict confirms full alignment [EVIDENCE: 2026-03-25 release-alignment normalization cross-checked spec.md, plan.md, and implementation-summary.md.]
- [x] CHK-042 [P2] Cross-references to other phase audits noted — out of scope for this LEAF task; parent catalog handles cross-phase references [EVIDENCE: 2026-03-25 release-alignment normalization cross-checked spec.md, plan.md, and implementation-summary.md.]

<!-- ANCHOR:file-org -->
## File Organization

- [x] CHK-050 [P1] Temp files in scratch/ only — no temp files created [EVIDENCE: 2026-03-25 release-alignment normalization cross-checked spec.md, plan.md, and implementation-summary.md.]
- [x] CHK-051 [P1] scratch/ cleaned before completion — no scratch files to clean [EVIDENCE: 2026-03-25 release-alignment normalization cross-checked spec.md, plan.md, and implementation-summary.md.]
- [x] CHK-052 [P2] Key findings saved to memory/ — findings captured in spec.md §12 and plan.md FINDINGS SUMMARY [EVIDENCE: 2026-03-25 release-alignment normalization cross-checked spec.md, plan.md, and implementation-summary.md.]

---

### Architecture Verification

- [x] CHK-100 [P1] Feature-to-source traceability matrix complete — findings table in spec.md §12 maps each feature to verdict and evidence [EVIDENCE: 2026-03-25 release-alignment normalization cross-checked spec.md, plan.md, and implementation-summary.md.]
- [x] CHK-101 [P1] All source file paths verified — eval_reporting_dashboard (8+2 files confirmed); eval_run_ablation source list noted as bloated [EVIDENCE: 2026-03-25 release-alignment normalization cross-checked spec.md, plan.md, and implementation-summary.md.]
- [x] CHK-102 [P2] Cross-category dependencies documented — no cross-category dependencies found for these 2 features [EVIDENCE: 2026-03-25 release-alignment normalization cross-checked spec.md, plan.md, and implementation-summary.md.]
