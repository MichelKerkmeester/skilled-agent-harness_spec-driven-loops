# 028 Benchmark Status (DoD criterion 4) + remaining cleanup (criterion 6)

Actionable record of the two open 028 completion items. Everything else (37 phases, all 42 sub-phases
built-or-gated, schema cluster, NO-GO, narrative docs, full changelog polish, 8/9 release-cleanup) is
committed and pushed.

## Criterion 4 — eval-harness benchmark pass: BLOCKED on a stale golden set (diagnosed)

The eval-harness and its gate-zero guard work as designed. `eval_run_ablation` correctly refused to
score and named the remediation. Root cause, confirmed by direct inspection:

- The golden set is STATIC and hand-curated: `mcp_server/lib/eval/data/ground-truth.json` mirrors
  `GROUND_TRUTH_QUERIES` + `GROUND_TRUTH_RELEVANCES` in `lib/eval/ground-truth-data.ts`.
  `generateGroundTruth()` just returns that static data; it does NOT derive labels from the live DB.
- Its relevance `memoryId`s reference parent IDs that have turned over: they resolve against
  `memory_history` (99/50 sampled) but only 1/50 against the active `memory_index` (20,050 rows).
- Net: 0 of 110 queries align with the current index. `scripts/map-ground-truth-ids.js --write` runs
  but rewrites nothing (no current targets to map to). There is no aligned subset to benchmark.

Remediation (deliberate data + judgment work, NOT implementation):
1. Re-curate `GROUND_TRUTH_RELEVANCES` against the live DB (assign each query its now-relevant
   `memory_index` IDs), or fix `map-ground-truth-ids.ts` to remap old->current by content/embedding.
2. Re-run `eval_run_ablation` (requires `SPECKIT_ABLATION=true`, already honored by the daemon).
3. Review the channel + C9 deltas, then flip ONLY the default-off flags whose own metric improves.
   Flipping memory-retrieval behavior defaults on a benchmark of unknown validity is high-blast and
   was deliberately NOT done; default-off is the correct conservative interim state.

Default-off flags awaiting per-flag benchmark evidence (registered in `tests/flag-ceiling.vitest.ts`):
SPECKIT_BITEMPORAL_RECALL, SPECKIT_AGENTIC_RECALL, SPECKIT_EDGE_PRESENCE_CURRENTNESS, plus the
derived-id / retention / semantic-edge / procedural / sleeptime / calibration flags from phases
009/011/017/012/018/020, and the advisor SPECKIT_ADVISOR_* shadow flags.

## Criterion 6 — release-cleanup: 8/9, two items blocked on a concurrent session

Done: 001, 002, 003 (skills subset), 004, 005, 007, 008, 009. Open:
- 006-commands: a concurrent session has the command docs (and deep-research, rrf-fusion.ts, .gitignore)
  dirty/uncommitted. Run after that session commits.
- 003's deep-research subset: the same concurrent session owns those SKILL.md/references/assets; the
  agent's overstep edits there were left uncommitted for reconciliation, not swept in.

These are external/coordination blockers, not implementation gaps.
