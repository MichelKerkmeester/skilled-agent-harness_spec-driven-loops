<!-- ANCHOR:problem -->
## 2. PROBLEM & PURPOSE

### Problem Statement
The first consolidation preserved old packets behind an extra archive layer, which made the active phase surface harder to browse.

### Purpose
Keep this theme as an active parent while making each original phase packet a direct child folder under the phase root.
<!-- /ANCHOR:problem -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:scope -->
## 3. SCOPE

### In Scope
- Keep the active thematic parent at `009-hook-daemon-parity/`.
- Place old phase packets directly under this root.
- Maintain `context-index.md` as the bridge from old phase identity to current child folder.

### Out of Scope
- Rewriting child-owned requirements or historical implementation narratives.
- Moving root `research/`, `review/`, or `scratch/` support folders.

### Files to Change

| File Path | Change Type | Description |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| `context-index.md` | Modify | Bridge index for the direct child phases in this theme. |
| `009-hook-daemon-parity/00N-*/` | Move | Original phase packet roots now live directly under this parent. |

<!-- ANCHOR:requirements -->
## 4. REQUIREMENTS

### P0 - Blockers (MUST complete)

| ID | Requirement | Acceptance Criteria |
|----|-------------|---------------------|
| REQ-001 | Preserve original child packet evidence. | Every mapped old phase exists as a direct child folder with root docs and metadata retained. |

### P1 - Required (complete OR user-approved deferral)

| ID | Requirement | Acceptance Criteria |
|----|-------------|---------------------|
| REQ-002 | Expose a concise context bridge. | `context-index.md` lists child phase names, statuses, summaries, open/deferred items, and current paths. |
| REQ-003 | Keep root support folders discoverable. | Root `research/`, `review/`, and `scratch/` remain referenced as root-level support surfaces. |
<!-- /ANCHOR:requirements -->

---

### Acceptance Scenarios

**Given** this wrapper is opened, **when** a maintainer lists the folder, **then** the original original phases appear as direct child folders.

**Given** a maintainer needs an original phase packet, **when** they open `context-index.md`, **then** they can find the old status, summary, and current child path.

<!-- ANCHOR:success-criteria -->
## 5. SUCCESS CRITERIA

- **SC-001**: The active parent validates independently.
- **SC-002**: Mapped source packets are direct child folders.

<!-- ANCHOR:risks -->
## 6. RISKS & DEPENDENCIES

| Type | Item | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------|--------|------------|
| Risk | Direct child folders may contain older validation debt | Medium | Validate the active parent separately and preserve child docs unchanged unless requested. |
| Dependency | Root packet phase map | High | Root docs own the active nine-phase map. |
