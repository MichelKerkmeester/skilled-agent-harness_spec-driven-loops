# Deep-Research Iteration 7 — 020 Wave-3 Validation (cli-copilot)

Dispatched via `copilot -p @PROMPT --model gpt-5.4 --allow-all-tools --no-ask-user`.

**Gate 3 pre-answered**: Option **E** (phase folder). Target `026/research/020-skill-advisor-hook-surface-001-initial-research-003-implementation-plan-validation-copilot/`. All writes pre-authorized. Proceed WITHOUT asking.

**Context**: Wave 1 (cli-codex, converged) + Wave 2 (cli-copilot extended, converged) both settled architecture and contract semantics. You are wave 3 — **validating the current 8-child implementation scaffold** (020/002-009). **DO NOT** re-open architecture. **DO NOT** propose new children beyond 002-009. Only challenge or validate the current scaffold content.

## STATE

Iteration: 7 of 20
Focus: **V7 Fail-open correctness error-mode walk**

## TASKS

1. Read wave-1 research.md §Failure Modes + Fail-Open Contract (11 error modes).
2. Read wave-2 research-extended.md §X5 (prompt-injection failure class).
3. For each error mode, verify:
   - 004's producer (spec.md §4 REQ-007) maps the error to status=fail_open + freshness=unavailable
   - 006/007/008 adapter specs inherit fail-open correctly at the runtime boundary
4. Flag any error mode NOT covered or ambiguously handled.
5. Check: does 004 handle SIGNAL_KILLED? Python missing? Subprocess timeout? Malformed JSON? Non-zero exit? SQLite busy retry? Deleted-skill cache? Unsupported hook input shape? Metalinguistic skill-name prompt poisoning?
6. Write iteration-007.md with error-mode coverage matrix + severity tags.

## CONSTRAINTS

- Soft cap 8 tool calls, hard max 12
- Iter 7 focus: V7 Fail-open correctness error-mode walk ONLY — do not drift
- REQUIRED canonical JSONL `"type":"iteration"` EXACTLY with schema below
- REQUIRED per-iter delta file
- Findings must cite file paths (e.g. `020/004/spec.md §4.1 REQ-007`) — no vague claims
- Severity tag every finding: P0 (blocks implementation) / P1 (should patch pre-impl) / P2 (defer/accept)
- Do NOT re-open architecture. Do NOT propose new children. Do NOT modify child spec.md files.

## OUTPUT CONTRACT

1. `iterations/iteration-007.md` — focused findings for iter 7 with severity-tagged items and file citations
2. Canonical JSONL appended to state.jsonl (exact shape):
   `{"type":"iteration","iteration":7,"newInfoRatio":0.60,"status":"in_progress","focus":"V7 Fail-open correctness error-mode walk","findingsCount":N,"keyQuestions":10,"answeredQuestions":M,"timestamp":"2026-04-19T...Z","durationMs":N,"graphEvents":[]}`
   (Adjust newInfoRatio honestly based on actual novelty — 0.60 is a guidance target for this iter position.)
3. `deltas/iter-007.jsonl` — structured per-iter delta with findings list

## NOTE ON CONVERGENCE

This is iter 7 of 20. If validation findings have saturated and no new P0/P1 gaps surface, set `newInfoRatio` low (below 0.05). Be honest — don't force novelty.
