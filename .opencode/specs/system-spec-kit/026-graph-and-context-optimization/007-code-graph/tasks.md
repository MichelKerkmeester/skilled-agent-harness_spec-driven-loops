## Task Notation

| `[P]` | Parallelizable |
| `[B]` | Blocked |

**Task Format**: `T### Description`
<!-- /ANCHOR:notation -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:phase-1 -->
## Phase 1: Setup

- [x] T001 Read child packet roots for `001-code-graph-upgrades/`, `002-code-graph-self-contained-package/`, and `003-code-graph-context-and-scan-scope/`.
- [x] T002 Capture status, summaries, unchecked item counts, and current paths.
<!-- /ANCHOR:phase-1 -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:phase-2 -->
## Phase 2: Implementation

- [x] T010 Move original phase folders to direct child paths.
- [x] T011 Regenerate `context-index.md` for this theme.
- [x] T012 Refresh parent and child metadata paths.
- [x] T013 Move code-graph context and scan-scope packet from `007-deep-review-remediation/` to `003-code-graph-package/003`.
<!-- /ANCHOR:phase-2 -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:phase-3 -->
## Phase 3: Verification

- [x] T020 Run strict validation for this parent.
- [x] T021 Confirm JSON metadata parses after flattening.
<!-- /ANCHOR:phase-3 -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:completion -->
## Completion Criteria

- [x] All child packets are represented in `context-index.md`.
- [x] Original folders are direct children.
- [x] Metadata contains migration aliases for moved packet IDs.
- [x] Code-graph context and scan-scope packet 003 is represented as a direct child.
