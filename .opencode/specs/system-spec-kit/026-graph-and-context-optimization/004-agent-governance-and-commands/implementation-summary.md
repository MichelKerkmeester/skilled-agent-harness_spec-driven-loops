<!-- ANCHOR:what-built -->
## What Was Built

This parent now holds 2 original phase packet(s) directly in its root. You can open `004-agent-governance-and-commands/` for the active story and inspect each old packet without going through an extra archive layer.

### Direct Children

- **`001-agent-execution-guardrails/`**: This packet now records the completed same-session execution-guardrail update for the three requested AGENTS files. In all three targets, the request-analysis framework still lives inside Section 1 `## 1. CRITICAL RULES` under `### Request Analysis & Execut...
- **`002-command-graph-consolidation/`**: You can now run `/spec_kit:plan` or `/spec_kit:complete` on any folder state and get canonical intake mechanics — five-state folder classification, four repair-mode branches, staged canonical-trio publication, relationship capture with `packet_id` dedup, re...

### Files Changed

| File | Action | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| `spec.md` | Modified | Active parent specification. |
| `context-index.md` | Modified | Bridge from old phase identity to direct child folders. |
| `00N-*/` | Moved | Preserved original packet folders as direct children. |

<!-- ANCHOR:how-delivered -->
## How It Was Delivered

The child folders were moved into the phase root, then metadata was updated with migration aliases so old packet IDs remain discoverable. Root research, review, and scratch folders stayed at the 026 packet root.

<!-- ANCHOR:decisions -->
## Key Decisions

| Decision | Why |
|----------|-----|
| Use direct child folders | This matches the requested layout and removes unnecessary nesting. |
| Keep child packet narratives intact | The original packets include nested children and evidence that should stay auditable. |
<!-- /ANCHOR:decisions -->

<!-- ANCHOR:verification -->
## Verification

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Child folder presence | PASS, mapped child folders are present at the phase root. |
| JSON metadata parse | PASS, metadata files are parse-checked by the root verification pass. |
| Parent validation | PASS, run with `validate.sh --strict --no-recursive` during flattening verification. |
<!-- /ANCHOR:verification -->

<!-- ANCHOR:limitations -->
## Known Limitations

1. **Historical citations stay historical.** Child packet prose may still mention old top-level paths when describing past work; `context-index.md` is the active bridge.
