      - question: "Does the narrow Chokidar watcher meet the ≤1% idle CPU / <20MB RSS gate?"
        answer: "Yes — measured cpuPercent=0.031, rssDeltaMb=5.516 on current skill set. Well under gate."
      - question: "Is the single-writer lease reclaim under two-daemon contention?"
        answer: "Yes — test 'two daemons contending → only one acquires' passes; stale-lease takeover returns to live with STALE_LEASE_TAKEOVER_LIVE reason."

# Implementation Summary: 027/001

## Status
**Complete** — implementation, local verification, and benchmark gate green as of 2026-04-20.

## What was shipped (11 files under `mcp_server/skill-advisor/`)

### Daemon (3 files)
- `lib/daemon/watcher.ts` — Chokidar narrow-scope watcher (SKILL.md + graph-metadata.json + derived.key_files dynamic additions); debounce 2s+1s provisional; hash-aware targeted reindex; ENOENT tolerance; atomic write helper
- `lib/daemon/lease.ts` — Workspace-scoped SQLite single-writer lease; heartbeat; stale-lease reclaim; SQLITE_BUSY backoff with retry budget
- `lib/daemon/lifecycle.ts` — Daemon boot, shutdown, SIGTERM handling, `unavailable` publication on exit

### Freshness (4 files)
- `lib/freshness/generation.ts` — Generation-tagged snapshots, post-commit publication, SQLite single-transaction boundary
- `lib/freshness/trust-state.ts` — `live` / `stale` / `absent` / `unavailable` semantics; readers never block
- `lib/freshness/rebuild-from-source.ts` — Corrupted SQLite detection + source-driven rebuild; returns to `unavailable` trust state during rebuild
- `lib/freshness/cache-invalidation.ts` — Targeted invalidation tied to generation bump

### Schemas (2 files)
- `schemas/daemon-status.ts` — Zod schema for daemon status + heartbeat + telemetry
- `schemas/generation-metadata.ts` — Zod schema for generation metadata

### Bench (1 file)
- `bench/watcher-benchmark.ts` — Benchmark harness measuring idle CPU + RSS over ≥60s; emits JSON report; asserts gate

### Tests (1 file, 16 test cases)
- `tests/daemon-freshness-foundation.vitest.ts` — Covers all 8 Acceptance Scenarios plus Track H hardening:
  - Atomic-rename handling
  - ENOENT during rename tolerated
  - SQLITE_BUSY backoff
  - Rebuild-from-source on corrupted SQLite
  - Single-writer lease: two daemons contending → only one acquires
  - Fail-open reader while daemon down
  - Freshness state transitions (all four)
  - Malformed SKILL.md quarantine path
  - TEST_SHUTDOWN publishes `unavailable`
  - Stale lease takeover → `STALE_LEASE_TAKEOVER_LIVE`

### Track H inline hardening
- Reindex-storm back-pressure (circuit breaker when N events in T window)
- Malformed SKILL.md quarantine (skill stays in quarantine table; daemon stays live)
- Partial-write resilience (atomic rename via .tmp + fsync + rename; ENOENT tolerated)
- SQLITE_BUSY backoff + bounded retry

## Verification

- **Targeted test suite:** `npx vitest run mcp_server/skill-advisor/tests/daemon-freshness-foundation.vitest.ts` → `1 passed, 16 tests passed in 123ms`
- **Combined with existing advisor-freshness:** `27 tests passed` (16 new + 11 pre-existing)
- **Typecheck:** `npm run typecheck` exit 0
- **Build:** `npm run build` exit 0
- **Benchmark (release gate):** `node dist/skill-advisor/bench/watcher-benchmark.js` → `cpuPercent=0.031, rssDeltaMb=5.516, rssTotalMb=66.266, passed=true`. Gate: ≤1% CPU / <20MB delta → **PASSED with margin**.

## Outstanding items

1. **Full 468-file vitest suite verification** — pre-existing slow suite (scripts/progressive-validation runs `bash validate.sh` 20-25s per test × many tests). Not a 001 regression; tracked as separate infrastructure issue. Targeted verification confirms no 001-caused regressions.
2. **E4 debounce calibration under burst load** — current values are provisional (2s+1s). A burst-benchmark follow-up (hundreds of rapid SKILL.md writes) should tune these empirically. Non-blocking for 027/001 release.
3. **Parent `implementation-summary.md` Children Convergence Log** — updated by orchestrator after this commit lands.

## Files changed

- 11 new files under `mcp_server/skill-advisor/`
- `mcp_server/vitest.config.ts` — added `mcp_server/skill-advisor/tests/**/*.{vitest,test}.ts` to include list (1-line surgical edit)
- `001-daemon-freshness-foundation/checklist.md` — marked items `[x]` with evidence citations
- `001-daemon-freshness-foundation/implementation-summary.md` — this file
