## Implementation Mapping

All paths are relative to `skill/system-spec-kit/`.

| Recommendation | Current Implementation | Verified |
|---------------|----------------------|----------|
| RRF Search Fusion | `mcp_server/lib/search/rrf-fusion.js` | Yes |
| BM25 Hybrid Search | `mcp_server/lib/search/bm25-index.js` | Yes |
| Intent-Aware Retrieval | `mcp_server/lib/search/intent-classifier.js` | Yes |
| Cross-Encoder Reranking | `mcp_server/lib/search/cross-encoder.js` | Yes |
| Session Deduplication | `mcp_server/lib/session/session-manager.js` | Yes |
| Tool Output Caching | `mcp_server/lib/cache/tool-cache.js` | Yes |
| Causal Memory Graph | `mcp_server/lib/storage/causal-edges.js` | Yes |
| Recovery Hints | `mcp_server/lib/errors/recovery-hints.js` | Yes |
| Type-Specific Half-Lives | `mcp_server/lib/config/memory-types.js` | Yes |
| Learning from Corrections | `mcp_server/lib/learning/corrections.js` | Yes |
| Standardized Response | `mcp_server/lib/response/envelope.js` | Yes |
| Layered Architecture | `mcp_server/lib/architecture/layer-definitions.js` | Yes |

## Verification Details

All 12 implementing files were verified to exist on disk at:
`/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Opencode Env/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/lib/`

**Verification date:** 2026-02-06
**Unverified files:** None (all 12/12 confirmed present)

## Source Documents

The following pre-analysis documents contain the original recommendations:

| Document | Focus |
|----------|-------|
| `001-a-analysis-cross-repository-architecture.md` | Cross-repository architecture patterns (dotmd, seu-claude, drift) |
| `001-b-analysis-repository-comparison.md` | Repository comparison for system-speckit enhancement |
| `001-c-analysis-three-system-architecture-review.md` | Three AI memory system analysis |
| `001-d-analysis-speckit-architecture-comparison.md` | Memory system architecture comparison |
| `002-a-recommendations-speckit-enhancement.md` | Prioritized enhancement recommendations |
| `002-b-recommendations-speckit-enhancement.md` | Enhancement recommendations (alternate perspective) |
| `002-c-recommendations-speckit-enhancement-roadmap.md` | Enhancement roadmap with phased implementation |
| `002-d-recommendations-speckit-improvements.md` | Improvement recommendations with priority matrix |

## Archival Decision

Per **DR-002**: Archive rather than update. All 081 recommendations have been implemented in the current codebase, making these documents entirely obsolete for forward-looking work. The successor spec `089-speckit-reimagined-refinement` contains the current audit and remediation plan.
