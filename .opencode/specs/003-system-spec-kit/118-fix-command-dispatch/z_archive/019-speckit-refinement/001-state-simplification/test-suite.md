## Execution Log

### Static Tests (Categories 1-4, 6)

```
2024-12-23 15:35 - Starting static tests...
T1.1: node --check → PASS (no syntax errors)
T1.2-T1.6: grep for helper functions → All found at expected lines
T1.7: grep "await updateStateFile" → Found commented out at line 2176
T1.8: grep "PROJECT_PHASE:" → Found in return object at line 3202
T2.1-T2.3: grep context_template.md → All template vars found
T3.1-T3.3: grep YAML files → 3-level priority confirmed, STATE.md only in deprecation notes
T4.1-T4.2: grep AGENTS.md → Uses "memory files", no STATE.md references
T6.1-T6.3: ls + grep → state.md.deprecated exists, SKILL.md has V13.0 note
```

### Integration Test (Category 5)

```
2024-12-23 15:36 - Spawning general agent to run generate-context.js...

Agent executed: node generate-context.js 004-speckit/010-speckit-refinement

Console output:
   ℹ️  Stateless mode detected: Spec folder provided directly
🚀 Starting memory skill...
📥 Step 1: Loading collected data...
   ✓ Captured 1 exchanges from OpenCode
📁 Step 2: Detecting spec folder...
   ✓ Using spec folder from CLI argument: 010-speckit-refinement
📂 Step 3: Setting up context directory...
   ✓ Created: .../specs/004-speckit/010-speckit-refinement/memory
🔄 Steps 4-7: Extracting data (parallel execution)...
   ✓ All extraction complete
📝 Step 8: Populating template...
   ✓ Template populated (quality: 100/100)
💾 Step 9: Writing files...
   ✓ 23-12-25_15-36__speckit-refinement.md (188 lines)
   ✓ metadata.json (39 lines)
📋 Step 9.5: State embedded in memory file (V13.0)
✅ Context saved successfully!
🧠 Step 11: Indexing semantic memory...
   ✓ Indexed as memory #103 (768 dimensions)

Output file analysis:
- File: 23-12-25_15-36__speckit-refinement.md (188 lines)
- PROJECT STATE SNAPSHOT section: Line 25
- State fields found:
  - Phase: "RESEARCH"
  - Active File: "N/A"
  - Last Action: "Tool: bash"
  - Next Action: "Continue implementation"
  - Blockers: "None"
```

## Verification: Generated Memory File Structure

The generated memory file (`23-12-25_15-36__speckit-refinement.md`) contains:

```markdown
## PROJECT STATE SNAPSHOT

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Phase | RESEARCH |
| Active File | N/A |
| Last Action | Tool: bash |
| Next Action | Continue implementation |
| Blockers | None |
```

This confirms the V13.0 state simplification is working correctly:
- State is embedded in memory files (not separate STATE.md)
- All 5 state fields are populated
- Template rendering is correct

---

## Notes

- Integration test used real OpenCode MCP context (agent captured 1 exchange)
- Script output shows "Step 9.5: State embedded in memory file (V13.0)" confirming the change
- STATE.md is properly deprecated - only .deprecated file exists
- Resume priority chain is simplified to 3 levels
- All 23 tests PASS
