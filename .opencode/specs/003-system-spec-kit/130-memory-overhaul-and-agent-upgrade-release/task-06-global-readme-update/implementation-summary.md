## What Was Built

Task 06 completed comprehensive updates to root README.md and .opencode/README.md, implementing 11 documented changes that simplify structure, improve clarity, and align with spec 130 narrative (spec-first framework).

### Summary

- **Root README.md**: Restructured feature section ordering (spec kit first, memory second), removed redundant marketing sections (Innovations, Why This System), simplified overview architecture explanation, standardized punctuation (colon instead of em-dash), added new Spec Kit Documentation feature section, and fixed ASCII diagram spacing.
- **.opencode/README.md**: Applied parallel simplifications for developer-facing documentation consistency.
- **Net result**: -105 lines (net simplification), improved readability, spec-first narrative alignment.

<!-- ANCHOR:decisions -->
## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Spec Kit First ordering | Aligns with overall narrative - spec kit is foundational, memory is enhancement |
| Remove Innovations section | Content was marketing-focused and redundant with feature sections |
| Remove Why This System section | Redundant two-column comparison; simplified overview for faster onboarding |
| Standardize punctuation to colons | Consistent formatting across all feature section titles |
| Remove ANCHOR tags from README | Internal memory indexing markers not needed in public-facing docs; preserved in SKILL.md and spec docs |
| Add Spec Kit Documentation feature section | Spec kit is foundational component deserving prominent feature coverage |
