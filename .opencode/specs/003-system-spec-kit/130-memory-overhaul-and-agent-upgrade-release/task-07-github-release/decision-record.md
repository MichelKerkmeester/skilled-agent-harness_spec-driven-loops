## ADR-001: Audit Scope Definition

### Metadata

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Status** | Accepted |
| **Date** | 2026-02-16 |
| **Deciders** | Michel, @speckit agent |

---

<!-- ANCHOR:adr-001-context -->
### Context

Task 07 requires systematic audit/creation of tagged releases for 3 tracks with GitHub release notes. The scope must be clearly defined to ensure complete coverage while avoiding scope creep into adjacent domains.

### Constraints
- Part of 7-task umbrella spec (130)
- Must be self-contained for independent agent execution
- Must produce actionable changes.md for implementer
- Time-boxed execution (part of larger alignment effort)
<!-- /ANCHOR:adr-001-context -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:adr-001-decision -->
### Decision

**Summary**: Audit/creation scope limited to tagged releases for 3 tracks with GitHub release notes with explicit file paths and audit criteria.

**Details**: Task spec provides complete list of files to audit/create, explicit criteria for what to check, and template for changes.md output. No wildcards, no implicit dependencies on other tasks.

<!-- ANCHOR:adr-001-alternatives -->
### Alternatives Considered

| Option | Pros | Cons | Score |
|--------|------|------|-------|
| **Explicit file list** | Complete, verifiable | More verbose | 9/10 |
| Wildcard patterns | Concise | Brittle, may miss files | 5/10 |
| Manual discovery | Flexible | Not reproducible | 3/10 |

**Why Chosen**: Explicit file lists ensure systematic coverage and enable verification of completion.

<!-- ANCHOR:adr-001-consequences -->
### Consequences

**Positive**:
- Agent can verify 100% coverage
- No ambiguity about what to audit/create
- changes.md is structured and actionable

**Negative**:
- More upfront spec work - Mitigation: Templates reduce effort

**Risks**:
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| File list becomes stale | M | Validate against current codebase before execution |

### Five Checks Evaluation

| # | Check | Result | Evidence |
|---|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | **Necessary?** | PASS | Systematic work required for alignment |
| 2 | **Beyond Local Maxima?** | PASS | Considered wildcard and manual approaches |
| 3 | **Sufficient?** | PASS | Explicit scope matches task needs |
| 4 | **Fits Goal?** | PASS | Directly enables documentation alignment |
| 5 | **Open Horizons?** | PASS | Reusable pattern for future tasks |

**Checks Summary**: 5/5 PASS

<!-- ANCHOR:adr-001-impl -->
### Implementation

**Affected Systems**:
- Task spec.md (audit/creation criteria)
- changes.md (output format)

**Rollback**: Expand or narrow scope if task proves too broad/narrow

## ADR-002: Version and Publication Strategy

### Metadata

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Status** | Accepted |
| **Date** | 2026-02-16 |
| **Deciders** | Michel, @speckit agent |

<!-- ANCHOR:adr-002-context -->
### Context

Task 07 requires a final public release entry that consolidates outputs from Tasks 01-06. The release must use a consistent semantic version strategy and avoid publishing from an unclean working tree.

### Constraints
- Tag and release naming must match spec-defined values
- Publication must reference a stable release commit
- Release notes must include Agent, Spec-Kit, and Documentation update categories
<!-- /ANCHOR:adr-002-context -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:adr-002-decision -->
### Decision

**Summary**: Use tag `v2.1.0.0` with release title `v2.1.0 - Memory Overhaul & Agent Upgrade Release`, and block publication until a clean release commit is available.

**Details**:
- Version strategy: minor environment release (`2.0.x` -> `2.1.0.0`) due cross-system documentation alignment.
- Publication strategy: prepare notes first, then tag and publish only after clean-tree verification.
- Breaking changes declaration remains `None` because this is documentation alignment, not runtime behavior change.
<!-- /ANCHOR:adr-002-decision -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:adr-002-consequences -->
### Consequences

**Positive**:
- Release metadata stays consistent across tag, title, and notes.
- Publication risk reduced by enforcing clean-commit gating.

**Negative**:
- Final release publication is delayed until working tree cleanup is complete.
