## What Was Built

Task 07 release preparation was completed for version `v2.1.0.0`. The release notes draft is finalized, publication blockers are documented, and Task 07 tracking artifacts were updated with evidence-backed status.

Completed work in this phase:
- Finalized release notes structure with required sections: Agent Updates, Spec-Kit Updates, Documentation Updates, and Breaking Changes.
- Documented release command template and target branch (`main`).
- Documented current publication blockers (clean working tree, final release commit, tag creation, release URL).
- Updated checklist/task status to reflect prep completion and publication blockers.

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Prepare release notes before publication steps | Enables review and sign-off while commit/tag blockers are resolved |
| Keep tag and release steps blocked until clean tree | Prevents publishing a release from an unstable workspace state |
| Use `v2.1.0.0` tag and `v2.1.0` release title | Matches task spec and existing release naming pattern |
| Record blockers directly in `changes.md` and checklist | Keeps Task 07 status auditable and avoids hidden assumptions |

<!-- ANCHOR:verification -->
## Verification

| Test Type | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Manual Review | Pass | Release notes sections and version consistency verified against task spec |
| Checklist Complete | Partial Pass | Prep checks completed; publication checks blocked by clean-commit requirement |
| Validation | Pass | Root spec folder validation passes with 0 errors and 0 warnings |

<!-- ANCHOR:limitations -->
## Known Limitations

Publication is pending because release execution prerequisites are not yet met:
- Working tree is not clean for release tagging.
- Final release commit hash is not yet selected for tag `v2.1.0.0`.
- GitHub release URL cannot be recorded until tag push and release creation complete.
