## ADR-001: Audit Scope Definition

<!-- ANCHOR:adr-001-context -->
### Context

Task 04 requires systematic audit/creation of agent configuration files across 3 platforms (OpenCode, Claude, Codex). The scope must be clearly defined to ensure complete coverage while avoiding scope creep into adjacent domains.

### Constraints
- Part of 7-task umbrella spec (130)
- Must be self-contained for independent agent execution
- Must produce actionable changes.md for implementer
- Time-boxed execution (part of larger alignment effort)

<!-- ANCHOR:adr-001-decision -->
### Decision

**Summary**: Audit/creation scope limited to agent configuration files across 3 platforms (OpenCode, Claude, Codex) with explicit file paths and audit criteria.

**Details**: Task spec provides complete list of files to audit/create, explicit criteria for what to check, and template for changes.md output. No wildcards, no implicit dependencies on other tasks.

### Alternatives Considered

| Option | Pros | Cons | Score |
|--------|------|------|-------|
| **Explicit file list** | Complete, verifiable | More verbose | 9/10 |
| Wildcard patterns | Concise | Brittle, may miss files | 5/10 |
| Manual discovery | Flexible | Not reproducible | 3/10 |

**Why Chosen**: Explicit file lists ensure systematic coverage and enable verification of completion.

### Consequences

**Positive**:
- Agent can verify 100% coverage
- No ambiguity about what to audit/create
- changes.md is structured and actionable

**Negative**:
- More upfront spec work - Mitigation: Templates reduce effort

**Risks**:
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| File list becomes stale | M | Validate against current codebase before execution |

### Five Checks Evaluation

| # | Check | Result | Evidence |
|---|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | **Necessary?** | PASS | Systematic work required for alignment |
| 2 | **Beyond Local Maxima?** | PASS | Considered wildcard and manual approaches |
| 3 | **Sufficient?** | PASS | Explicit scope matches task needs |
| 4 | **Fits Goal?** | PASS | Directly enables documentation alignment |
| 5 | **Open Horizons?** | PASS | Reusable pattern for future tasks |

**Checks Summary**: 5/5 PASS

### Implementation

**Affected Systems**:
- Task spec.md (audit/creation criteria)
- changes.md (output format)

**Rollback**: Expand or narrow scope if task proves too broad/narrow
