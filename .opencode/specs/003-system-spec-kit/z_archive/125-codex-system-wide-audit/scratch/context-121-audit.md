# Audit Report: Spec Folder 121-script-audit-comprehensive

**Report Date:** 2026-02-15  
**Auditor:** @general (Code Review Specialist)  
**Subject:** Spec Folder 003-system-spec-kit/121-script-audit-comprehensive  
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Status:** FILESYSTEM ORPHANED + INCOMPLETE SESSION

---

## Executive Summary

Spec folder `003-system-spec-kit/121-script-audit-comprehensive` exists **only in the memory database** (Memory ID #1346) but is **NOT present on the filesystem**. This represents a critical data consistency failure: the session memory shows incomplete work (17% complete), malformed documentation, and failed tool execution traces. The spec folder has no supporting documentation artifacts (spec.md, plan.md, checklist.md, tasks.md).

**Immediate Action Required:** Determine whether to restore from backup, delete orphaned memory, or reconstruct the spec folder with proper documentation.

## Findings

### Planned vs Implemented Deltas

| Aspect | Plan | Implementation | Delta |
|--------|------|---|---|
| **Spec Folder Creation** | Create 121-script-audit-comprehensive | NOT CREATED on filesystem | ❌ MISSING |
| **Session Completion** | Implied (folder exists in memory) | 17% complete, IN_PROGRESS status | ❌ INCOMPLETE |
| **Documentation** | spec.md, plan.md, checklist.md | 0 files created | ❌ ALL MISSING |
| **Work Artifacts** | Script audit findings | Session shows incomplete tool traces | ❌ NO DELIVERABLES |

**Evidence:**
- Filesystem verification via glob pattern `.opencode/specs/003-system-spec-kit/121-script-audit-comprehensive/**` returned: **NO MATCHES**
- Read tool attempts on expected paths returned: **NOT FOUND errors**
- Memory ID #1346 exists with timestamp `15-02-26_11-06` but points to non-existent filesystem path

### Completeness & Quality Assessment

**Missing Artifacts (ALL CRITICAL):**
- ❌ `spec.md` — No specification document
- ❌ `plan.md` — No implementation plan
- ❌ `checklist.md` — No verification checklist
- ❌ `tasks.md` — No task tracking
- ❌ `implementation-summary.md` — No summary (post-implementation artifact)
- ❌ `scratch/` — No temporary work files

**Incomplete Session Documentation:**
- **Status:** IN_PROGRESS (17% complete)
- **Tool Execution:** Minimal traces (read, glob, bash) with evidence of failures
- **Content Quality:** Malformed/incomplete with "[TBD]" placeholders
- **Memory Corruption:** Referenced filesystem path does not exist on disk

**Documentation Quality Issues:**
- Session memory shows failed tool execution (Tool: read returned error)
- No clear task breakdown or work progression documented
- Memory metadata indicates session was abandoned mid-work
- No evidence of completion verification or validation steps

### Defects & Workflow Mismatches

**Critical Defects:**

1. **Filesystem-Memory Mismatch**
   - Memory database contains reference to non-existent spec folder
   - Indicates workflow failure during spec folder creation or deletion
   - **Type:** Data consistency violation
   - **Impact:** Session context orphaned, no recovery path without manual intervention

2. **Incomplete Session with No Error Handling**
   - Session marked IN_PROGRESS (17%) but work never completed
   - No error logs or halt conditions documented
   - Session appears abandoned without closure/handover
   - **Type:** Workflow incompletion
   - **Impact:** Unclear whether work should resume or be discarded

3. **Missing Spec Folder Creation**
   - Directory `.opencode/specs/003-system-spec-kit/121-script-audit-comprehensive/` not present
   - No `memory/` subdirectory created
   - No template files from system-spec-kit skill applied
   - **Type:** Spec Kit workflow violation
   - **Impact:** Violates AGENTS.md §4 documentation requirements

4. **Memory File References Non-Existent Path**
   - Memory ID #1346 points to: `/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Opencode Env/Public/.opencode/specs/003-system-spec-kit/121-script-audit-comprehensive/memory/15-02-26_11-06__script-audit-comprehensive.md`
   - Path does not exist on filesystem
   - Memory cannot be loaded via standard file tools
   - **Type:** Orphaned memory reference
   - **Impact:** Memory metadata corrupt; spec folder recovery blocked

**Workflow Mismatches:**

- **Missing Gate 3 Verification:** No evidence that spec folder was properly created per system-spec-kit skill
- **No Completion Verification:** No checklist.md + verification evidence per AGENTS.md §4
- **Abandoned Session:** No handover.md or session closure artifacts per AGENTS.md §9
- **Memory Corruption:** generate-context.js script not used properly (memory file should be auto-indexed, not manually created with broken path)

## Evidence

### Filesystem Verification
- **Glob Pattern:** `.opencode/specs/003-system-spec-kit/121-script-audit-comprehensive/**`
- **Result:** NO FILES FOUND
- **Verification Method:** glob, grep, read tools all returned NOT FOUND errors
- **Conclusion:** Spec folder does not exist on disk

### Memory Database Evidence
- **Memory ID:** 1346
- **Status:** IN_PROGRESS
- **Completion:** 17%
- **Referenced Path:** `/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Opencode Env/Public/.opencode/specs/003-system-spec-kit/121-script-audit-comprehensive/memory/15-02-26_11-06__script-audit-comprehensive.md`
- **Filesystem Match:** ❌ PATH DOES NOT EXIST
- **Content State:** Malformed with incomplete documentation and failed tool traces

### Expected vs Actual File Structure

**Expected Structure (per system-spec-kit):**
```
.opencode/specs/003-system-spec-kit/121-script-audit-comprehensive/
├── spec.md                          [Level 1+ required]
├── plan.md                          [Level 1+ required]
├── tasks.md                         [Level 1+ required]
├── checklist.md                     [Level 2+ required if QA needed]
├── implementation-summary.md        [Level 1+ required after implementation]
├── memory/
│   └── [context preservation files]
└── scratch/                         [temporary work]
```

**Actual Structure:**
```
.opencode/specs/003-system-spec-kit/121-script-audit-comprehensive/
[DOES NOT EXIST ON FILESYSTEM]
```

### Tool Execution Traces (from Memory)
- Tool: read → Error (path not found)
- Tool: glob → Error (pattern yielded no results)
- Tool: bash → Error (command execution incomplete)
- **Conclusion:** Session execution was incomplete and error-prone

## Risks

### HIGH SEVERITY

1. **Data Loss Risk**
   - Session work may be permanently lost
   - No backup/recovery mechanism identified
   - Memory entry may be outdated/corrupted
   - **Mitigation:** Determine if work should be preserved or discarded

2. **Workflow Integrity Violation**
   - Orphaned memory entry violates AGENTS.md §4 spec folder requirements
   - Future sessions may reference this broken state
   - **Mitigation:** Audit entire memory database for similar orphaned entries

3. **Spec Kit System Failure**
   - generate-context.js script may not have been invoked properly
   - Manual memory file creation bypassed auto-indexing
   - **Mitigation:** Review how memory files are being created/indexed

### MEDIUM SEVERITY

4. **Session Abandonment**
   - No handover.md or /spec_kit:handover evidence
   - Unclear whether work should resume or restart
   - **Mitigation:** Clarify session closure protocol

5. **Missing Audit Artifacts**
   - Original audit scope/findings not documented
   - Cannot verify what was supposed to be audited
   - **Mitigation:** Reconstruct audit scope from commit history or user intent

## Recommended Fixes

### IMMEDIATE (Priority P0)

**1. Determine Spec Folder Disposition**
   - **Decision Point:** Should this work be recovered or discarded?
   - **If RECOVER:** Proceed to steps 2-4
   - **If DISCARD:** Jump to step 5 only

**2. Restore Spec Folder Structure (if recovering)**
   ```bash
   # Create proper spec folder structure
   mkdir -p .opencode/specs/003-system-spec-kit/121-script-audit-comprehensive/{memory,scratch}
   
   # Initialize with system-spec-kit templates
   # Use @speckit agent to apply proper template files
   ```
   - **Action Owner:** @speckit agent
   - **Validation:** Verify spec.md, plan.md created with correct template structure

**3. Reconstruct Documentation from Memory**
   - Extract content from Memory ID #1346
   - Manually recreate spec.md, plan.md, checklist.md
   - Preserve any audit findings in implementation-summary.md
   - **Action Owner:** @speckit agent or manual reconstruction
   - **Validation:** All Level 1 files present and properly formatted

**4. Reindex Memory with Correct Path**
   - Use generate-context.js script to properly create memory entry:
     ```bash
     node .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/dist/memory/generate-context.js \
       specs/003-system-spec-kit/121-script-audit-comprehensive
     ```
   - Delete orphaned Memory ID #1346
   - Verify new memory entry with correct filesystem path
   - **Action Owner:** Memory system maintenance
   - **Validation:** memory_search() returns valid file path matching filesystem

### SECONDARY (Priority P1)

**5. Delete Orphaned Memory Entry (if discarding)**
   ```
   Memory delete: ID #1346
   Confirm: Yes, permanently remove orphaned entry
   ```
   - **Action Owner:** Memory system maintenance
   - **Validation:** spec_kit_memory_memory_list() no longer shows ID #1346

**6. Audit Similar Orphaned Entries**
   - Query memory database for other IN_PROGRESS entries > 1 week old
   - Verify filesystem paths exist for all spec folder references
   - Create summary report of other orphaned entries
   - **Action Owner:** @context or @debug agent
   - **Pattern:** Look for similar filesystem-memory mismatches

**7. Process Improvement**
   - Review workflow: How did this orphaned state occur?
   - Verify spec folder creation process uses @speckit agent exclusively
   - Verify memory file creation uses generate-context.js script (not manual Write)
   - Add pre-flight validation to Gate 3 to catch similar issues
   - **Action Owner:** System maintainer
   - **Validation:** Updated AGENTS.md or spec_kit workflow documentation
