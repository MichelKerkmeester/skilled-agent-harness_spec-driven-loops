# Decision Record: Post-Research Wave 1 (Governance Foundations)

<!-- SPECKIT_TEMPLATE_SOURCE: phase-package-decision-record | v1.1 -->

<!-- ANCHOR:delegation -->
## Decision Record Delegation

This phase package delegates decision records to the parent spec folder.

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Canonical Source | `../decision-record.md` |
| Reason | Phase packages do not maintain independent ADRs; all architectural decisions are recorded at root level to prevent fragmentation |
| Package Scope | `004-post-research-wave-1-governance-foundations` |

### Package-Relevant Decisions (Root Cross-References)

Decisions relevant to this wave's scope (adaptive fusion, typed trace, artifact-aware routing, governance approvals):

- **ADR-001 through ADR-006**: See `../decision-record.md` for full records
- **Post-research wave model**: Documented in `../spec.md` §3.7 and `../plan.md` §2.7
- **Wave 1 capability ownership**: Frozen per `../plan.md` REQUIREMENT OWNERSHIP MATRIX

<!-- ANCHOR:context -->
## Context

Wave 1 exists to establish governance-safe runtime foundations before controlled delivery. The package intentionally references root ADRs so that contract, routing, and fusion decisions remain centralized in a single canonical record.

<!-- ANCHOR:decision -->
## Decision

Maintain root-level ADR ownership in `../decision-record.md` and use this package decision record only for scoped cross-reference and wave-specific interpretation.

<!-- ANCHOR:consequences -->
## Consequences

- Prevents ADR drift across wave packages.
- Requires package files to keep root references synchronized after each update.
- Keeps review traffic concentrated in one decision source while preserving package traceability.
