# Phase Package Spec: Post-Research Wave 1 (Governance Foundations)

<!-- SPECKIT_TEMPLATE_SOURCE: phase-package-spec | v1.1 -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:executive-summary -->
## Executive Summary

This package defines the first post-research delivery wave for governance readiness and deterministic hybrid retrieval foundations.

Primary outcome: establish contract-safe retrieval behavior, telemetry evidence depth, and triad approval readiness before controlled delivery.
<!-- /ANCHOR:executive-summary -->

<!-- ANCHOR:problem-statement -->
## Problem Statement

This package addresses the governance and deterministic-foundation gap identified in post-research analysis: the MCP working-memory hybrid-RAG system requires typed contracts, artifact-aware routing, adaptive fusion policy, and formal governance closure before controlled delivery can proceed safely. See parent `../spec.md` §4 for canonical requirements.

## 2. Scope Boundaries

### In Scope
- Backlog IDs `C136-08`, `C136-09`, `C136-10` for typed contracts, artifact-aware routing baseline, adaptive hybrid fusion, and typed degraded-mode contracts.
- Backlog ID `C136-12` for telemetry expansion required by governance review and downstream wave gating.
- Governance closure items `C136-01`, `C136-02`, `C136-03` for Tech Lead, Data Reviewer, and Product Owner approvals.

### Out of Scope
- Controlled-delivery execution items `C136-04`, `C136-05`, `C136-11` (Wave 2).
- Outcome-confirmation items `C136-06`, `C136-07` (Wave 3).
- Legacy implementation evidence from packages `001`, `002`, and `003`.

## Requirements (Package Slice)

This package inherits requirements from the parent spec. Package-owned requirements:

| ID | Requirement | Acceptance Criteria |
|----|------------|---------------------|
| C136-08 | Typed `ContextEnvelope` + `RetrievalTrace` contracts | Compile/test pass with mandatory trace stages: `candidate`, `filter`, `fusion`, `rerank`, `fallback`, `final-rank` |
| C136-09 | Artifact-class routing table | Class-specific policies for `spec`, `plan`, `tasks`, `checklist` with deterministic verification tests |
| C136-10 | Adaptive hybrid fusion + typed degraded-mode contracts | Feature-flagged dynamic weighting by intent/document-type; typed degraded-mode fields (`failure_mode`, `fallback_mode`, `confidence_impact`, `retry_recommendation`) |
| C136-12 | Telemetry expansion | Latency/mode/fallback/quality-proxy dimensions captured and reported |
| C136-01 | Tech Lead approval | Signed closure artifact archived |
| C136-02 | Data Reviewer approval | Telemetry interpretation notes with acceptance decision |
| C136-03 | Product Owner approval | Acceptance-criteria alignment confirmation |

## Canonical Requirement Linkage

This package keeps parent requirements authoritative and references the canonical IDs directly (no package-local rewrites):

- `REQ-001` - inherited from `../spec.md` section 4 and applied to Wave 1 contract hardening scope.
- `REQ-002` - inherited from `../spec.md` section 4 and applied to typed retrieval-envelope behavior.
- `REQ-003` - inherited from `../spec.md` section 4 and applied to deterministic trace-stage coverage.
- `REQ-004` - inherited from `../spec.md` section 4 and applied to artifact-class routing policy.
- `REQ-005` - inherited from `../spec.md` section 4 and applied to fallback safety expectations.
- `REQ-006` - inherited from `../spec.md` section 4 and applied to adaptive-fusion governance controls.
- `REQ-007` - inherited from `../spec.md` section 4 and applied to telemetry evidence expectations.
- `REQ-008` - inherited from `../spec.md` section 4 and applied to review and closure readiness criteria.

All wording and acceptance authority remains in `../spec.md` section 4.

<!-- ANCHOR:acceptance-scenarios -->
## Acceptance Scenarios (Wave 1 Readiness)

1. **Given** Wave 1 implementation starts, **when** retrieval traces are emitted, **then** every trace includes `candidate`, `filter`, `fusion`, `rerank`, `fallback`, and `final-rank` stages.
2. **Given** artifact routing policies are configured, **when** class `spec`, `plan`, `tasks`, or `checklist` is requested, **then** deterministic class policy selection is applied and test-verifiable.
3. **Given** adaptive fusion is enabled for a supported intent, **when** scoring executes, **then** intent/document-type weighting is applied with deterministic fallback parity available.
4. **Given** degraded-mode behavior is triggered, **when** fallback metadata is produced, **then** `failure_mode`, `fallback_mode`, `confidence_impact`, and `retry_recommendation` are present.
5. **Given** Wave 1 telemetry collection runs, **when** evidence is exported for review, **then** latency, mode, fallback, and quality-proxy dimensions are all included.
6. **Given** governance closure is requested, **when** triad review occurs, **then** Tech Lead, Data Reviewer, and Product Owner approval artifacts are all attached.

## 3. Requirement Mapping (Package Slice)

| Priority | Backlog IDs | Package Interpretation |
|----------|-------------|------------------------|
| P0 | `C136-08`, `C136-09`, `C136-10`, `C136-01`, `C136-02`, `C136-03` | Runtime-contract readiness (adaptive fusion + typed trace + artifact-aware routing + degraded-mode contracts) plus governance sign-off gates required before Wave 2 expansion |
| P1 | `C136-12` | Telemetry depth required for reviewer interpretation and rollout evidence quality |

This package maps post-research backlog ownership from root docs without redefining canonical acceptance criteria.
