# Research Summary: Post-SpecKit Template Upgrade - Command Alignment

## Research Methodology

**Dispatch**: 10 Opus 4.5 agents executed in parallel
**Date**: 2026-01-20
**Duration**: ~3-5 minutes total

---

## Agent Findings Summary

### Agent 1: Spec 072 Analysis

**Key Findings**:
- Version aligned to 1.7.2 across all files
- 2 CRITICAL + 10 HIGH priority issues fixed
- Memory scoring unified in `folder-scoring.js`
- Constitutional tier now always surfaces at top
- Deprecated: complexity detection system, expansion templates
- Performance: RRF fusion O(n*m) → O(n+m), ~200x faster

**Command Impacts**:
- `memory:*` commands benefit from improved scoring
- Constitutional memories always appear first in search results

---

### Agent 2: Spec 073 Analysis

**Key Findings**:
- CORE + ADDENDUM v2.0 architecture implemented
- 64-79% template reduction achieved
- Templates in `templates/level_N/` folders (N=1,2,3,3+)
- Workstream notation added: `[W-A]`, `[W-B]`, `[SYNC]`
- Sections removed: Stakeholders, Traceability, Assumptions Validation, KPI Targets

**Command Impacts**:
- Template paths changed to `templates/level_N/`
- Level selection uses value-based scaling, not just LOC

---

### Agent 3: Spec 074 Analysis

**Key Findings**:
- Version bumped to 1.9.0
- Verbose templates created (26 files in `templates/verbose/`)
- `compose.sh` script created (1,021 lines)
- `SPECKIT_TEMPLATE_STYLE` environment variable added
- WHEN TO USE sections restored as HTML comments

**Command Impacts**:
- New `--verbose-templates` flag available in create.sh
- Environment variable controls template style selection

---

### Agent 4: Spec 075 Analysis

**Key Findings**:
- 557 tests executed, 97% pass rate (540 passed, 17 skipped)
- All P0 critical tests verified
- 15 recommendations documented (5 implemented, 10 deferred)
- Known limitations: cognitive test paths, mock infrastructure

**Command Impacts**:
- Validation workflow fully operational
- All 14 MCP tools callable and verified

---

### Agent 5: SKILL.md Analysis

**Key Findings**:
- 10 core capabilities documented
- 7 primary workflows: complete, plan, research, implement, debug, resume, handover
- 14 MCP tools operational
- Six-tier importance system with constitutional tier
- Checkpoint save/restore system operational

**Gaps Identified**:
- Mode support (:auto, :confirm) execution details not fully specified
- Cross-skill handoff protocols incomplete

---

### Agent 6: References Analysis

**Key Findings**:
- 19 reference files analyzed across 7 categories
- Environment variables: 20+ documented
- Memory system: 6-tier importance, decay scoring, constitutional tier
- Templates: CORE + ADDENDUM v2.0 with verbose variants
- Validation: 13 rules with 3 severity levels
- Workflows: 6 scripts documented

**Command Implications**:
- Gate 3 triggers (33 phrases) documented
- Memory save workflow requires generate-context.js (not Write tool)

---

### Agent 7: spec_kit Commands Analysis

**Key Findings**:
- 7 commands analyzed: complete, debug, handover, implement, plan, research, resume
- Frontmatter: 7/7 fully compliant
- Mandatory Gates: 7/7 implemented
- All support :auto/:confirm modes (except debug)

**Gaps Identified**:
- Section ordering inconsistent (research.md has INSTRUCTIONS at Section 5)
- Missing OUTPUT FORMATS sections in 4 commands
- Missing RELATED COMMANDS sections in 4 commands
- Gate 3 declaration not explicit in all commands

---

### Agent 8: memory Commands Analysis

**Key Findings**:
- 4 commands analyzed: checkpoint, database, save, search
- Frontmatter: 4/4 fully compliant
- Mandatory Gates: 3/4 (search missing gate)
- MCP integration: Excellent

**Gaps Identified**:
- `/memory:search` missing mandatory gate for `<id>` required arg
- `/memory:database` line 393 has incorrect cross-reference
- Missing VIOLATION SELF-DETECTION in database.md

---

### Agent 9: search/create Commands Analysis

**Key Findings**:
- 8 commands analyzed (2 search + 6 create)
- Frontmatter: 6/8 compliant, 2 minor issues
- Mandatory Gates: All present where required
- Chained execution pattern in skill_asset/skill_reference

**Gaps Identified**:
- `/create:skill` argument-hint: `skill-name` should be `<skill-name>`
- `/create:agent` argument-hint: `agent-name` should be `<agent-name>`

---

### Agent 10: Compliance Audit

**Key Findings**:
- 19 commands audited against command_template.md
- Section Structure: **0/19 fully compliant** (all use non-standard `🔜`)
- Mandatory Gates: 18/19 compliant (search.md fails)
- Frontmatter: 19/19 compliant
- Step Numbering: 19/19 compliant
- Status Output: 19/19 compliant
- Examples: 19/19 compliant

**Critical Issue**:
All 19 commands use `🔜 WHAT NEXT?` section header, but `🔜` is not in the approved emoji vocabulary.

---

## Consolidated Gap Analysis

### Critical (All Commands Affected)

| Issue ID | Description | Affected | Fix |
|----------|-------------|----------|-----|
| GAP-001 | Non-standard `🔜` emoji | 19 commands | Replace with `📌 NEXT STEPS` |
| GAP-002 | Extra text in headers | ~10 commands | Remove parentheticals |

### High Priority

| Issue ID | Description | Affected | Fix |
|----------|-------------|----------|-----|
| GAP-003 | Missing mandatory gate | /memory:search | Add multi-phase gate |
| GAP-004 | Argument-hint format | 2 commands | Add angle brackets |
| GAP-005 | Missing OUTPUT FORMATS | 4 commands | Add section |

### Medium Priority

| Issue ID | Description | Affected | Fix |
|----------|-------------|----------|-----|
| GAP-006 | Cross-reference error | /memory:database | Fix line 393 |
| GAP-007 | Missing RELATED COMMANDS | 4 commands | Add section |
| GAP-008 | Missing Gate 3 declaration | 5 commands | Add section |

---

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate**: Standardize `🔜 WHAT NEXT?` → `📌 NEXT STEPS` across all 19 commands
2. **High**: Add mandatory gate to `/memory:search`
3. **High**: Fix argument-hint format in `/create:skill` and `/create:agent`
4. **Medium**: Add OUTPUT FORMATS sections to spec_kit commands
5. **Low**: Fix cross-reference error in `/memory:database`
