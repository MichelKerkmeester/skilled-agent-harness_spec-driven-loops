# Phase Package Spec: Post-Research Wave 3 (Outcome Confirmation)

<!-- SPECKIT_TEMPLATE_SOURCE: phase-package-spec | v1.1 -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:executive-summary -->
## Executive Summary

This package defines final outcome confirmation work after controlled delivery evidence is complete.

Primary outcome: capture user-perceived outcomes and sustained KPI closure evidence for final post-research acceptance.
<!-- /ANCHOR:executive-summary -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:problem-statement -->
## Problem Statement

This package addresses the outcome-confirmation gap: after controlled delivery, the system requires real-user survey evidence, sustained KPI measurement over a 14-day window, and capability truth matrix longitudinal drift analysis before final post-research acceptance. See parent `../spec.md` §4 for canonical requirements.

<!-- ANCHOR:scope -->
## 2. Scope Boundaries

### In Scope
- Backlog ID `C136-06` for real-user survey outcomes and scoring with capability truth matrix interpretation.
- Backlog ID `C136-07` for 14-day KPI closure evidence with baseline comparison and runtime-generated capability truth matrix drift confirmation.

### Out of Scope
- Wave 1 and Wave 2 implementation items and governance/delivery mechanics.
- New runtime feature additions outside closure and outcome confirmation.

## Requirements (Package Slice)

This package inherits requirements from the parent spec. Package-owned requirements:

| ID | Requirement | Acceptance Criteria |
|----|------------|---------------------|
| C136-06 | Real-user survey outcomes | Survey dataset with scored summary, response distribution, and capability truth matrix interpretation |
| C136-07 | 14-day KPI closure evidence | 14-day KPI baseline comparison report with closure decision note, capability truth matrix drift analysis, and recommendation rationale |

<!-- ANCHOR:canonical-requirement-linkage -->
## Canonical Requirement Linkage

This package keeps parent requirements authoritative and references canonical IDs directly for outcome confirmation work:

- `REQ-001` - inherited from `../spec.md` section 4 and applied to closure-context consistency.
- `REQ-002` - inherited from `../spec.md` section 4 and applied to deterministic reporting inputs.
- `REQ-003` - inherited from `../spec.md` section 4 and applied to traceable closure evidence packaging.
- `REQ-004` - inherited from `../spec.md` section 4 and applied to fallback-aware interpretation of KPI behavior.
- `REQ-005` - inherited from `../spec.md` section 4 and applied to stability checks across the 14-day window.
- `REQ-006` - inherited from `../spec.md` section 4 and applied to capability-truth-matrix interpretation controls.
- `REQ-007` - inherited from `../spec.md` section 4 and applied to telemetry-backed closure confidence.
- `REQ-008` - inherited from `../spec.md` section 4 and applied to final recommendation traceability.

All normative wording remains in `../spec.md` section 4.

<!-- ANCHOR:acceptance-scenarios -->
## Acceptance Scenarios (Wave 3 Outcome Closure)

1. **Given** Wave 3 starts, **when** survey collection opens, **then** response capture includes scoring inputs required for closure interpretation.
2. **Given** survey analysis executes, **when** outcome summaries are generated, **then** capability truth matrix interpretation notes are included.
3. **Given** KPI observation begins, **when** day-by-day telemetry is reviewed, **then** baseline comparison remains reproducible across the full 14-day window.
4. **Given** capability matrix snapshots are produced, **when** start, midpoint, and end states are compared, **then** drift analysis is documented with rationale.
5. **Given** closure recommendation is drafted, **when** evidence is assembled, **then** user outcomes and KPI longitudinal results are both represented.
6. **Given** final acceptance review occurs, **when** Wave 3 package is evaluated, **then** closure artifacts are ready for root checklist completion without adding new runtime scope.

## 3. Requirement Mapping (Package Slice)

| Priority | Backlog IDs | Package Interpretation |
|----------|-------------|------------------------|
| P2 | `C136-06`, `C136-07` | Outcome confirmation and longitudinal closure evidence after delivery stabilization, including capability truth matrix publication and drift analysis |

This package closes post-research outcomes with user and KPI evidence rather than new runtime feature scope.

## 4. Root Mapping

| Root Artifact | Coverage in this Package |
|---------------|--------------------------|
| `../spec.md` | Phase documentation map and post-research wave ownership mapping |
| `../plan.md` | Wave 3 sequencing and closure criteria |
| `../tasks.md` | `C136-06`, `C136-07` |
| `../checklist.md` | `CHK-227-228` |
<!-- /ANCHOR:root-mapping -->

<!-- ANCHOR:acceptance-targets -->
## 5. Acceptance Targets

| Target | Threshold |
|--------|-----------|
| Real-user survey outcomes | Survey dataset published with scored summary, response distribution, and capability truth matrix interpretation |
| 14-day KPI closure evidence | 14-day KPI baseline comparison report published with closure decision note, capability truth matrix drift analysis, and recommendation rationale |
| Capability truth matrix | Runtime-generated matrix snapshots published, consumed by docs/handover, and validated for closure window consistency |
<!-- /ANCHOR:acceptance-targets -->

<!-- ANCHOR:dependencies -->
## 6. Dependencies and Handoffs

- Depends on controlled delivery outputs from package `../005-post-research-wave-2-controlled-delivery/`.
- Uses telemetry dimensions from Wave 1 (`C136-12`) and rollout artifacts from Wave 2 (`C136-04`, `C136-05`).
- Produces final post-research closure evidence consumed by root checklist completion.

### Technical Capability Ownership (Wave 3)

| Capability | Owned in this package | Backlog Link |
|------------|-----------------------|--------------|
| Capability truth matrix longitudinal confirmation | Yes | `C136-06`, `C136-07` |
| Outcome/KPI closure decision evidence | Yes | `C136-06`, `C136-07` |

## 7. Governance (Level 3+ Package Rules)

- This package is Level 3+ planning documentation.
- `decision-record.md` present as delegation stub; canonical ADRs at `../decision-record.md`.
- `implementation-summary.md` present as compliance normalization record; substantive summary at `../implementation-summary.md`.
- Root documents remain source-of-truth for completion claims.

<!-- ANCHOR:status -->
## 8. Status Statement

Planned transition package for post-research Wave 3. Execution has not started in this file set; scope is execution-ready for final longitudinal confirmation and closure once Wave 2 evidence is complete.
