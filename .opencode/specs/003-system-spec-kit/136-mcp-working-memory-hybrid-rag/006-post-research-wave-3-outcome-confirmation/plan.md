# Phase Package Plan: Post-Research Wave 3 (Outcome Confirmation)

<!-- SPECKIT_LEVEL: 3+ -->
<!-- SPECKIT_TEMPLATE_SOURCE: phase-package-plan | v1.1 -->

<!-- ANCHOR:objective -->
## 1. Objective

Confirm user outcomes and sustained KPI performance after controlled delivery evidence is complete.

<!-- ANCHOR:technical-context -->
## Technical Context

This wave consumes Wave 2 rollout evidence and Wave 1 telemetry dimensions. It measures user-perceived outcomes via structured survey and tracks system KPI stability over a 14-day observation window. The capability truth matrix is runtime-generated from the MCP server's actual retrieval pipeline behavior. See parent `../plan.md` §3 for full architecture.

## 2. Quality Gates

### Definition of Ready
- Wave 2 package `../005-post-research-wave-2-controlled-delivery/` has published rollout evidence outputs.
- Telemetry and stage-gate artifacts are available for longitudinal comparison.
- Root task/checklist mappings for `C136-06` and `C136-07` are synchronized.
- Runtime capability truth matrix generator is available and version-pinned for closure reporting.

### Definition of Done
- `C136-06` survey outcomes and scored summary are published.
- `C136-07` 14-day KPI closure evidence with baseline comparison is published.
- Closure recommendation is ready for root checklist and sign-off review.
- Capability truth matrix longitudinal drift analysis is included in closure recommendation.

## 3. Execution Model

| Workstream | Backlog IDs | Duration | Output |
|------------|-------------|----------|--------|
| User outcome capture | `C136-06` | 2-3 days | Survey dataset, scored summary, response distribution, and capability truth matrix interpretation |
| Longitudinal KPI closure | `C136-07` | 14-day window + 1 day analysis | 14-day KPI baseline comparison report with closure decision note, capability truth matrix drift analysis, and recommendation rationale |

<!-- ANCHOR:milestones -->
## 4. Milestones

| Milestone | Exit Criteria |
|-----------|---------------|
| W3-M1 | `C136-06` complete with survey dataset, scored summary, and matrix interpretation artifact |
| W3-M2 | `C136-07` complete with 14-day KPI closure report, capability matrix drift report, and recommendation |

<!-- ANCHOR:risk-register -->
## 5. Risk Register

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Survey response quality is weak | Inconclusive user-outcome claims | Define minimum response thresholds and structured rubric before launch |
| KPI variance over 14 days regresses | Closure criteria reopened | Monitor leading indicators daily and document rollback/tuning triggers |
| Incomplete telemetry lineage | Weak baseline comparison confidence | Require Wave 2 handoff artifacts before starting KPI closure analysis |
| Capability matrix drift is not captured | False closure confidence | Require runtime-generated matrix snapshots at start/mid/end of closure window and include drift rationale |

<!-- ANCHOR:dependencies -->
## 6. Dependencies

- Depends on Wave 2 completion from package `../005-post-research-wave-2-controlled-delivery/`.
- Uses telemetry dimensions from Wave 1 (`C136-12`) and rollout artifacts from Wave 2 (`C136-04`, `C136-05`) to contextualize closure evidence.
- Feeds final closure evidence into root `../checklist.md` and sign-off workflow.

<!-- ANCHOR:governance -->
## 7. Governance Notes

- Level 3+ package planning is maintained here.
- `decision-record.md` remains root-only at `../decision-record.md`.
- `implementation-summary.md` is intentionally absent until implementation work exists.
