        ## 2. PROBLEM & PURPOSE

        ### Problem Statement
        Specification: CSS Performance Upgrade (Content Visibility) 1. Context The `content-visibility` CSS property is a powerful performance primitive that allows the browser to skip the rendering work of an element's subtree until it is needed (i.e., when it approaches the viewport).

        ### Purpose
        Keep the archived record for Specification: CSS Performance Upgrade (Content Visibility) readable, structurally valid, and faithful to the original implementation intent.
        <!-- /ANCHOR:problem -->

        <!-- ANCHOR:scope -->
        ## 3. SCOPE

        ### In Scope
        - **Global Utility**: Implement as a global CSS utility class.
- ## 3. Implementation Details.
- title: "Implementation Plan: CSS Performance Upgrade [01--anobel.com/z_archive/010-css-performance-cv/plan]".

        ### Out of Scope
        - Re-implementing the archived feature from scratch.
- Changing production behavior beyond documentation normalization.
- Replacing historical decisions that belong to the archive record.

        ### Files to Change

        | File Path | Change Type | Description |
        |-----------|-------------|-------------|
        | `src/1_css/global/performance.css` | Modify | Referenced by the archived work and retained in the normalized record |
| `code_quality_standards.md` | Modify | Referenced by the archived work and retained in the normalized record |

        ## 4. REQUIREMENTS

        ### P0 - Blockers (MUST complete)

        | ID | Requirement | Acceptance Criteria |
        |----|-------------|---------------------|
        | REQ-001 | The archived record clearly captures the core change described for Specification: CSS Performance Upgrade (Content Visibility). | Reviewer can confirm this is explicitly documented in the archive folder |
        | REQ-002 | The normalized spec identifies the primary files, components, or pages affected by the work. | Reviewer can confirm this is explicitly documented in the archive folder |
        | REQ-003 | The archive captures verification expectations or completed checks. | Reviewer can confirm this is explicitly documented in the archive folder |

        ### P1 - Required (complete OR user-approved deferral)

        | ID | Requirement | Acceptance Criteria |
        |----|-------------|---------------------|
        | REQ-004 | The documentation avoids broken local markdown references and invalid template structure. | Reviewer can confirm this is explicitly documented in the archive folder |
        | REQ-005 | The record notes important dependencies or rollout constraints mentioned in the archive. | Reviewer can confirm this is explicitly documented in the archive folder |

        ### Acceptance Scenarios

        1. **Given** the archived documents for Specification: CSS Performance Upgrade (Content Visibility), **When** a reviewer opens `spec.md`, **Then** the original problem and purpose are clear.
2. **Given** the scope section, **When** a reviewer checks the documented implementation surface, **Then** primary references such as `src/1_css/global/performance.css` are visible.
3. **Given** the normalized plan, **When** a reviewer reads the phases and testing strategy, **Then** the delivery and verification flow can be reconstructed.
4. **Given** the supporting documents, **When** a reviewer inspects them, **Then** checklist, tasks, and summary remain aligned.

        | Type | Item | Impact | Mitigation |
        |------|------|--------|------------|
        | Dependency | Archived implementation context | Future readers may miss why the change mattered | Problem statement and plan summary retain the original intent |
        | Risk | Over-normalizing historical notes | Subtle archived details could be lost | Keep folder-specific description and file references visible |
        | Risk | Stale environment assumptions | Replaying the work later may require fresh verification | Checklist and limitations call out archive-only status |

        <!-- ANCHOR:questions -->
        ## 10. OPEN QUESTIONS

        - Archived follow-up should focus on whether the documented implementation still matches current production behavior.
        - Resume work only after re-validating the referenced files and dependencies.
