## 2. PROBLEM & PURPOSE

### Problem Statement
Download buttons on anobel.com were not working on mobile devices (especially iOS). Users would tap the download button but nothing would happen - the file wouldn't download and the button animation wouldn't trigger properly.

### Purpose
Enable reliable PDF downloads on all mobile devices with proper visual feedback (spinner during loading, checkmark on success).

<!-- ANCHOR:scope -->
## 3. SCOPE

### In Scope
- Fix download button click handling on mobile
- Add spinner animation during download
- Fix iOS-specific download behavior
- Update all HTML files with new version

### Out of Scope
- Changing the PDF hosting location - files remain on Webflow CDN
- Native iOS "Save to Files" behavior - iOS will open PDFs in viewer

### Files to Change

| File Path | Change Type | Description |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| `src/1_css/button/btn_download.css` | Modify | Add anchor overlay fix + spinner animation |
| `src/2_javascript/molecules/btn_download.js` | Modify | Fix iOS download path with loading state |
| `src/0_html/nobel/*.html` | Modify | Bump version to v1.3.0 + add CSS link |
| `src/0_html/contact.html` | Modify | Bump version to v1.3.0 + add CSS link |
| `src/0_html/services/*.html` | Modify | Bump version to v1.3.0 + add CSS link |
