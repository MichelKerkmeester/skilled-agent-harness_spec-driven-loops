## What Was Built

### File 1: `.opencode/skills/system-skill-advisor/mcp_server/lib/metrics.ts`

**Import change (line 6):**
- Removed: `mkdirSync, writeFileSync` from `node:fs`
- Added: `mkdir, writeFile` from `node:fs/promises`

**Closure-scoped dirReady flag (line 153):**
- Added `let dirReady = false;` outside function scope

**`ensureParentDir` → async (line 218-222):**
- Converted from sync `mkdirSync(dirname(path), ...)` to async `await mkdir(dirname(path), ...)`
- Added closure-scoped `dirReady` guard: directory created only once per module lifetime

**`writeBoundedJsonl` → async (line 243-248):**
- Added `if (!process.env.SKILL_ADVISOR_DEBUG) return;` — diagnostic logging is opt-in
- `ensureParentDir(path)` → `await ensureParentDir(path)`
- `writeFileSync(path, ...)` → `await writeFile(path, ..., 'utf8')`
- Read-then-rewrite-last-N pattern preserved intact

**`persistAdvisorHookDiagnosticRecord` → async (line 337-344):**
- Changed to `export async function`
- `writeBoundedJsonl(...)` → `await writeBoundedJsonl(...)`
- Return type: `string` → `Promise<string>`

**`persistAdvisorHookOutcomeRecord` → async (line 411-418):**
- Changed to `export async function`
- `writeBoundedJsonl(...)` → `await writeBoundedJsonl(...)`
- Return type: `string` → `Promise<string>`

### File 2: `.opencode/skills/system-code-graph/mcp_server/handlers/ccc-feedback.ts`

**Import change (line 6):**
- Removed: `appendFileSync, mkdirSync` from `node:fs`
- Added: `appendFile, mkdir` from `node:fs/promises`

**safeStringify helper (line 17-19):**
- Added `function safeStringify(arg: unknown): string` with try/catch fallback to `String(arg)`

**Closure-scoped dirReady flag (line 12):**
- Added `let dirReady = false;` outside function scope

**mkdir call (line 51-53):**
- Replaced `mkdirSync(dirname(feedbackPath), { recursive: true })` with:
  ```ts
  if (!dirReady) {
    await mkdir(dirname(feedbackPath), { recursive: true });
    dirReady = true;
  }
  ```

**appendFile call (line 63):**
- Replaced `appendFileSync(feedbackPath, JSON.stringify(entry) + '\n', 'utf-8')` with:
  ```ts
  await appendFile(feedbackPath, safeStringify(entry) + '\n', 'utf-8');
  ```
- AWAITED (not fire-and-forget)
- Error-return contract preserved via existing try/catch that returns MCP error response
- NO env-var enable gate (user-facing feedback persistence, must always run)
<!-- /ANCHOR:what-built -->

<!-- ANCHOR:how-delivered -->
## How It Was Delivered

- All edits in-place using exact string replacement
- No new files created
- Backward compatible: async functions return Promises; existing callers already use `await`
<!-- /ANCHOR:how-delivered -->

<!-- ANCHOR:decisions -->
## Key Decisions

| Decision | Why |
|----------|-----|
| `SKILL_ADVISOR_DEBUG` env gate defaults OFF | Diagnostic JSONL logging is only for debugging; production should not write per-invocation metrics to disk |
| Closure-scoped `dirReady` replaces eager `mkdirSync` | Directory is created once per module lifetime instead of on every writeBoundJsonl call |
| `ccc-feedback.ts` NO env gate | User-facing feedback persistence must always run; feedback data loss is unacceptable |
| `ccc-feedback.ts` AWAITED appendFile | Prevents silent data loss from fire-and-forget async writes |
| `safeStringify` helper for ccc-feedback | Defense-in-depth against JSON.stringify errors on unexpected input shapes |
| Bounded retention logic unchanged | `writeBoundedJsonl` still reads last N records and rewrites — no behavior change |
| Error-return contract unchanged | ccc-feedback try/catch around appendFile still returns the same MCP error response shape |

## Verification

### TypeScript Typecheck
- Shared system-spec-kit typecheck (`npm run typecheck`): passed ✓
- Code-graph callsites verified: all existing callers already use `await` ✓

### Tests
- Skill-advisor vitest: 34 suites passed, 243 tests passed ✓
- Pre-existing failures (not caused by our changes):
  - `tests/compat/shim.vitest.ts`: 4 failures — Python shim exit code 2 (missing Python/NPM deps)
  - `tests/manual-testing-playbook.vitest.ts`: 1 failure — doc count mismatch (46 vs 45)
  - 22 suites: missing `@spec-kit/shared/embeddings/factory.js` (build artifact not generated)
- Code-graph targeted test: vitest config excludes stress_test directory (pre-existing exclusion)

### Smoke tests
- `writeBoundedJsonl` respects `SKILL_ADVISOR_DEBUG` gate: returns immediately when env var not set ✓
- `ccc-feedback` error contract preserved: try/catch around `await appendFile` returns MCP error ✓
- Bounded retention (read-then-rewrite-last-N) preserved intact ✓
- Closure-scoped `dirReady` prevents repeated mkdir calls ✓

### Strict validate
- `bash .opencode/skills/system-spec-kit/scripts/spec/validate.sh .../003-h3-async-iife-h6-lazy-mkdir --strict` → exit 0 ✓

<!-- ANCHOR:limitations -->
## Known Limitations

1. `SKILL_ADVISOR_DEBUG` must be explicitly set for diagnostic logging — no fallback auto-detection.
2. Code-graph stress test excluded by vitest config (pre-existing) — integration testing on the feedback path requires a real MCP server run.
3. Skill-advisor test suite has pre-existing build/environment failures unrelated to this refactor.
4. Latency improvement measurement deferred — expected benefit from async I/O and lazy directory creation is theoretical until a synthetic workload benchmark is run.
