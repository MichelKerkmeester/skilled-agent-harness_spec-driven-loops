# Implementation Plan: Phase 6: codegraph-tombstone-audit

<!-- SPECKIT_LEVEL: 1 -->
<!--
SELF-CHECK:
- Confirm the plan names the simplest viable approach, affected surfaces, and verification path.
- Match phases to the stated scope; remove setup theater that does not change the outcome.
FAILURE MODES:
- Over-planning, missing rollback, and treating assumptions as dependencies.

## 1. SUMMARY

### Technical Context

| Aspect | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Language/Stack** | TypeScript (Node) |
| **Framework** | mk_code_index MCP daemon |
| **Storage** | code-graph SQLite (AST index) |
| **Testing** | vitest |

### Overview
Planned adoption of the cited 027 feature; full problem/scope/requirements live in this phase's spec.md. Implementation is deferred (scaffold-only packet).

## 2. QUALITY GATES

### Definition of Ready
- [ ] Problem statement clear and scope documented
- [ ] Success criteria measurable
- [ ] Dependencies identified

### Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Tests passing (if applicable)
- [ ] Docs updated (spec/plan/tasks)
<!-- /ANCHOR:quality-gates -->

<!-- ANCHOR:architecture -->
## 3. ARCHITECTURE

### Pattern
[MVC | MVVM | Clean Architecture | Serverless | Monolith | Other]

### Key Components
- **[Component 1]**: [Purpose]
- **[Component 2]**: [Purpose]

### Data Flow

## FIX ADDENDUM: AFFECTED SURFACES

Use this section when `research_intent=fix_bug`, when planning from a deep-review FAIL/CONDITIONAL verdict, or when any finding touches security, path handling, env precedence, schema boundaries, persistence, public responses, or shared policy.

| Surface | Current Role | Action | Verification |
|---------|--------------|--------|--------------|
| [producer/helper/policy] | [what owns the behavior] | [update/unchanged/not a consumer] | [grep/test/doc evidence] |
| [consumer/status/docs/tests] | [how it observes the behavior] | [update/unchanged/not a consumer] | [grep/test/doc evidence] |

Required inventories:
- Same-class producers: `rg -n '<field|string|helper|literal|error-pattern>' <module-or-files>`.
- Consumers of changed symbols: `rg -n '<changedSymbol>|<changedConstant>|<changedPublicField>' . --glob '*.ts' --glob '*.js' --glob '*.md'`.
- Matrix axes: list every independent input axis and the required rows before implementation.
- Algorithm invariant: for path/redaction/parser/resolver/security fixes, state the invariant and adversarial cases.

- [ ] [Core feature 3]

### Phase 3: Verification
- [ ] Manual testing complete
- [ ] Edge cases handled
- [ ] Documentation updated

|-----------|-------|-------|
| Unit | [Components/functions] | [Jest/pytest/etc.] |
| Integration | [API endpoints/flows] | [Tools] |
| Manual | [User journeys] | Browser |

## 6. DEPENDENCIES

| Dependency | Type | Status | Impact if Blocked |
|------------|------|--------|-------------------|
| [System/Library] | [Internal/External] | [Green/Yellow/Red] | [Impact] |

<!-- ANCHOR:rollback -->
## 7. ROLLBACK PLAN

- **Trigger**: [Conditions requiring rollback]
- **Procedure**: [How to revert changes]

<!--
CORE TEMPLATE (~90 lines)
- Essential technical planning
- Simple phase structure
- Add L2/L3 addendums for complexity
