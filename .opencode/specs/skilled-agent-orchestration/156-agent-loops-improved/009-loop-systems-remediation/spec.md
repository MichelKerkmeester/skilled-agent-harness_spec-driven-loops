<!--
SELF-CHECK:
- Confirm the artifact states the current problem, intended outcome, scope, and verification evidence.
- Remove placeholders, stale status, and claims that are not backed by a check.
FAILURE MODES:
- Scope drift, vague acceptance criteria, and optimistic done-language without evidence.

## PHASE DOCUMENTATION MAP

> This spec uses phased decomposition. Each phase is an independently executable child spec folder. All implementation details (plan, tasks, checklist, decisions, continuity) live inside the phase children.

| Phase | Folder | Focus | Status |
|-------|--------|-------|--------|
| 1 | 001-deep-improvement-rollback-hash-guard/ | [Phase 1 scope] | Pending |
| 2 | 002-deep-improvement-promotion-safety/ | [Phase 2 scope] | Pending |
| 3 | 003-model-benchmark-reducer-ledger/ | [Phase 3 scope] | Pending |
| 4 | 004-adversarial-playbook-scenarios/ | [Phase 4 scope] | Pending |
| 5 | 005-tighten-playbook-pass-criteria/ | [Phase 5 scope] | Pending |
| 6 | 006-p2-test-adequacy-and-source-only-audit/ | [Phase 6 scope] | Pending |

### Phase Transition Rules

- Each phase MUST pass `validate.sh` independently before the next phase begins
- Parent spec tracks aggregate progress via this map
- Use `/spec_kit:resume [parent-folder]/[NNN-phase]/` to resume a specific phase
- Run `validate.sh --recursive` on parent to validate all phases as integrated unit

### Phase Handoff Criteria

| From | To | Criteria | Verification |
