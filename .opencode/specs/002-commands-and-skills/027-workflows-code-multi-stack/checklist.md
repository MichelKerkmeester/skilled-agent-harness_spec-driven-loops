# Checklist - workflows-code Conversion

<!-- ANCHOR:protocol -->
## Verification Protocol

| Priority | Handling | Completion Impact |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| **[P0]** | HARD BLOCKER | Cannot claim done until complete |
| **[P1]** | Required | Must complete OR get user approval |
| **[P2]** | Optional | Can defer with documented reason |

## Pre-Implementation

### Research & Documentation
- [x] Analyzed Barter's workflows-code structure
- [x] Identified all reference files (38 total across stacks)
- [x] Documented which files to keep/remove/anonymize
- [x] Created research.md with file inventory
- [x] Created decision-record.md with key decisions
- [x] Spec folder upgraded to Level 3+

### Key Decisions Made
- [x] Replace Angular with React/Next.js (user requirement)
- [x] Target stacks: React, React Native, Go, Swift, Node.js
- [x] Three-level anonymization approach
- [x] Directory structure by stack type
- [x] Replace existing workflows-code (not create new skill)

## Quality Gates

### Anonymization Verification (MANDATORY)
```bash
# Run before claiming completion
grep -ri "barter" .opencode/skill/workflows-code/
grep -ri "fe-partners" .opencode/skill/workflows-code/
grep -ri "backend-system" .opencode/skill/workflows-code/
grep -ri "gaia" .opencode/skill/workflows-code/
grep -ri "deals\|partners\|companies" .opencode/skill/workflows-code/

# All must return 0 results
```

### Content Completeness (MANDATORY)
- [ ] React patterns cover equivalent topics as Angular (7 files)
- [ ] Go patterns maintain technical depth (12 files)
- [ ] React Native patterns fully functional (8 files)
- [ ] Stack detection covers all target stacks
