## AI Execution Protocol

### Pre-Task Checklist

Before starting each task, verify:

1. [x] Load `spec.md` and verify scope hasn't changed
2. [x] Load `plan.md` and identify current phase
3. [x] Load `tasks.md` and find next uncompleted task
4. [x] Verify task dependencies are satisfied
5. [x] Load `checklist.md` and identify relevant P0/P1 items
6. [x] Check for blocking issues in `decision-record.md`
7. [x] Verify `memory/` folder for context from previous sessions
8. [x] Confirm understanding of success criteria
9. [x] Begin implementation only after all checks pass

### Execution Rules

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| TASK-SEQ | Complete tasks in dependency order |
| TASK-SCOPE | Stay within task boundary, no scope creep |
| TASK-VERIFY | Verify each task against acceptance criteria |
| TASK-DOC | Update status immediately on completion |

### Status Reporting Format
