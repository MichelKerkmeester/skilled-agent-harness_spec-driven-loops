## What Was Built

Phase 004 completed the highest-volume rename in the skill-rename program, migrating from the legacy documentation-skill name to `sk-documentation`, with the skill folder, changelog folder, cross-runtime agent references, command references, install-guide references, and system-spec-kit HVR paths aligned to the new name.

### Files Changed

| File | Action | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| `.opencode/skill/sk-documentation/` | Renamed/Updated | New canonical skill folder with 49 files present |
| `.opencode/changelog/06--sk-documentation/` | Renamed | Changelog folder aligned with new skill name |
| `.opencode/agent/write.md` | Modified | Runtime write agent references updated to `sk-documentation` |
| `.opencode/agent/chatgpt/write.md` | Modified | ChatGPT write agent references updated |
| `.claude/agents/write.md` | Modified | Claude write agent references updated |
| `.gemini/agents/write.md` | Modified | Gemini write agent references updated |
| `.opencode/agent/orchestrate.md` | Modified | Runtime orchestrate references updated |
| `.opencode/agent/chatgpt/orchestrate.md` | Modified | ChatGPT orchestrate references updated |
| `.claude/agents/orchestrate.md` | Modified | Claude orchestrate references updated |
| `.gemini/agents/orchestrate.md` | Modified | Gemini orchestrate references updated |
| `.opencode/command/create/*.md` | Modified | Command templates now reference `sk-documentation` |
| `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/templates/` | Modified | HVR reference paths now target `sk-documentation` |
| `.opencode/skill/scripts/skill_advisor.py` | Modified | Skill mapping entries moved from old to new skill name |

<!-- ANCHOR:how-delivered -->
## How It Was Delivered

Delivery used a mechanical rename-and-verify workflow: rename paths, update internal and external references, then prove completion with grep-based negative checks (old name absent), positive checks (new name present), filesystem presence checks, and a skill advisor smoke test. Phase documentation was then synchronized to completion state with explicit evidence.

<!-- ANCHOR:decisions -->
## Key Decisions

| Decision | Why |
|----------|-----|
| Treat binary DB hits as non-blocking for rename verification | Search over `.opencode/skill/` can include SQLite artifacts in `system-spec-kit/mcp_server/database/`; active-text checks were executed with `rg` and binary globs excluded. |
| Use thresholded skill-advisor smoke test for this phase | `python3 .../skill_advisor.py "create documentation"` currently returns an empty array without threshold filtering; `--threshold 0.8` returns `sk-documentation` as top skill. |
| Keep evidence command-based and reproducible | Every completion claim is backed by command output that can be re-run from repo root. |

## Verification

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| `rg -n --hidden --glob '!*.sqlite' --glob '!*.sqlite*' "<legacy-documentation-skill-name>" .opencode/skill/ .opencode/command/ .opencode/agent/ .opencode/install_guides/ .claude/ .gemini/ CLAUDE.md README.md` | PASS - no matches (`EXIT:1`) |
| `rg -n "HVR_REFERENCE.*<legacy-documentation-skill-name>" .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/templates/` | PASS - no matches (`EXIT:1`) |
| Directory checks for new/old paths and file count | PASS - `NEW_SKILL_DIR:yes`, `OLD_SKILL_DIR:no`, `NEW_CHANGELOG_DIR:yes`, `OLD_CHANGELOG_DIR:no`, `SK_DOC_FILE_COUNT:49` |
| Agent reference coverage check | PASS - `rg -n "sk-documentation"` across 8 runtime agent files returned 135 matches; old-name search returned none (`EXIT:1`) |
| Command template coverage check | PASS - 6/6 files under `.opencode/command/create/` contain `sk-documentation` |
| skill_advisor mapping check | PASS - `.opencode/skill/scripts/skill_advisor.py` has 8 `sk-documentation` entries and 0 legacy-name entries |
| skill_advisor smoke test | PASS - `python3 .opencode/skill/scripts/skill_advisor.py "create documentation" --threshold 0.8` produced `TOP_SKILL:sk-documentation` (`TOP_CONFIDENCE:0.81`) |
| Phase spec validator | PASS WITH WARNINGS - `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/spec/validate.sh .opencode/specs/002-commands-and-skills/038-skill-rename/004-sk-documentation` returned `Errors: 0, Warnings: 3, EXIT:1` |

<!-- ANCHOR:limitations -->
## Known Limitations

1. The non-threshold `skill_advisor.py "create documentation"` call returns `[]` in current scoring behavior; this phase therefore records the thresholded smoke test as authoritative evidence.
2. Validation evidence is command-output based; it verifies rename completeness and reference integrity, but it does not execute runtime behavior of each referenced skill.
