<!-- ANCHOR:protocol -->
## Phase 1: Build extract_structure.py

- [x] CHK001 [P0] Script created at `.opencode/skills/create-documentation/scripts/extract_structure.py` | Evidence: File exists; produces JSON output
- [x] CHK002 [P0] Script outputs valid JSON to stdout | Evidence: `python3 .opencode/skills/create-documentation/scripts/extract_structure.py .opencode/skills/create-documentation/SKILL.md | python3 -m json.tool >/dev/null` exits 0
- [x] CHK003 [P0] Frontmatter parsing works (extracts name, description, allowed-tools) | Evidence: `/tmp/extract_structure.json` includes `frontmatter.parsed.name/description/allowed-tools`
- [x] CHK004 [P0] Heading extraction works (level, text, line, emoji detection) | Evidence: `/tmp/extract_structure.json` includes `structure.headings[]` with `level/text/line/has_emoji`
- [x] CHK005 [P1] Section extraction works (content, word count, code block detection) | Evidence: `/tmp/extract_structure.json` includes `structure.sections[]`
- [x] CHK006 [P1] Code block extraction works (language, line count, preview) | Evidence: `/tmp/extract_structure.json` includes `structure.code_blocks[]`
- [x] CHK007 [P1] Metrics calculation works (words, lines, headings, code blocks) | Evidence: `/tmp/extract_structure.json` includes `metrics.*`
- [x] CHK008 [P0] Document type detection works (skill, readme, command, spec, etc.) | Evidence: `/tmp/extract_structure.json` has `type: "skill"`
- [x] CHK009 [P0] Type-specific checklist runs and returns pass/fail results | Evidence: `/tmp/extract_structure.json` includes `checklist.pass_rate` (e.g. `91.7`)
- [x] CHK010 [P1] Evaluation questions generated based on document type | Evidence: `/tmp/extract_structure.json` includes `evaluation_questions[]`
- [x] CHK011 [P0] YAML multiline description detected as checklist failure | Evidence: `markdown-document-specialist validate specs/012-doc-specialist-refactor/scratch/bad-multiline --json` exits 1; `/tmp/bad_multiline.json` message mentions multiline description
- [x] CHK012 [P0] Invalid allowed-tools format detected as checklist failure | Evidence: `markdown-document-specialist validate specs/012-doc-specialist-refactor/scratch/bad-tools --json` exits 1; `/tmp/bad_tools.json` message mentions array format

<!-- ANCHOR:code-quality -->
## Phase 2: Enhance quick_validate.py

- [x] CHK013 [P0] YAML multiline description detection added | Evidence: Negative test `specs/012-doc-specialist-refactor/scratch/bad-multiline` fails validation (exit 1)
- [x] CHK014 [P1] allowed-tools array format validation added | Evidence: Negative test `specs/012-doc-specialist-refactor/scratch/bad-tools` fails validation (exit 1)
- [x] CHK015 [P1] JSON output option (--json flag) works | Evidence: `python3 .opencode/skills/create-documentation/scripts/quick_validate.py .opencode/skills/create-documentation --json | python3 -m json.tool >/dev/null` exits 0
- [x] CHK016 [P2] TODO placeholder detection in description | Evidence: Warnings generated for TODO in description

<!-- /ANCHOR:code-quality -->

<!-- ANCHOR:testing -->
## Phase 3: Update CLI Wrapper

- [x] CHK017 [P0] `extract` subcommand added and routes to extract_structure.py | Evidence: `.opencode/skills/create-documentation/markdown-document-specialist extract .opencode/skills/create-documentation/SKILL.md | python3 -m json.tool >/dev/null` exits 0
- [x] CHK018 [P0] `--phase` argument removed | Evidence: Spec/docs refer to removed phase; CLI currently supports `extract/validate/init/package` only
- [x] CHK019 [P1] Help text updated to reflect new commands | Evidence: `markdown-document-specialist --help` shows extract/validate/init/package commands
- [x] CHK020 [P1] Old analyze_docs.py references removed from CLI | Evidence: `grep -c analyze_docs .opencode/skills/create-documentation/markdown-document-specialist` returns 0

<!-- /ANCHOR:testing -->

<!-- ANCHOR:docs -->
## Phase 4: Update SKILL.md
