### Context

The visual-explainer source material contains 5 commands, 11 diagram types, 9 aesthetic profiles, a CSS pattern library (~15KB), a library guide (~16KB), and 3 HTML templates. Putting all of this into a single SKILL.md file would far exceed the 5,000-word limit enforced by package_skill.py. We needed to decide how to structure the skill to fit within framework constraints while preserving all content.

### Constraints

- SKILL.md hard limit of 5,000 words (enforced by package_skill.py validation)
- Total content exceeds 10,000 words across all sections
- Skill must be discoverable as a single unit via skill_advisor.py
<!-- /ANCHOR:adr-001-context -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:adr-001-decision -->
### Decision

**We chose**: Skill Graph architecture with SKILL.md as a lean router, index.md as a Map of Content, and 10 node files for detailed content.

**How it works**: SKILL.md (~1,683 words) contains the Smart Router pseudocode and high-level overview. index.md organizes nodes into 4 groups (Foundation, Workflow, Design System, Reference) via wikilinks. Each node file is self-contained and loaded on demand by the AI agent based on the task at hand.
<!-- /ANCHOR:adr-001-decision -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:adr-001-alternatives -->
### Alternatives Considered

| Option | Pros | Cons | Score |
|--------|------|------|-------|
| **Skill Graph (chosen)** | Fits word limit; progressive loading; modular maintenance | More files to manage; wikilink resolution needed | 9/10 |
| Monolithic SKILL.md | Single file; simple to maintain | Exceeds 5,000-word limit; wastes context on irrelevant sections | 3/10 |
| Split into multiple skills | Each skill stays small | Breaks discoverability; 5 separate routing entries needed | 4/10 |

**Why this one**: Skill Graph is the only approach that keeps SKILL.md under the 5,000-word limit while preserving all content in a discoverable, progressively-loadable structure.
<!-- /ANCHOR:adr-001-alternatives -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:adr-001-consequences -->
### Consequences

**What improves**:
- SKILL.md stays at 1,683 words (66% under the 5,000-word limit)
- Agents load only the nodes they need, reducing context usage
- Each node can be updated independently without affecting others

**What it costs**:
- 12 files instead of 1 for the skill core. Mitigation: index.md MOC provides clear navigation.

**Risks**:

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Broken wikilinks if files are renamed | M | Verification step checks all 10 links resolve |

**What changes**:
- Created `.opencode/skill/workflows-visual-explainer/SKILL.md` (router, 1,683 words)
- Created `.opencode/skill/workflows-visual-explainer/index.md` (MOC, 4 groups, 10 wikilinks)
- Created 10 files in `.opencode/skill/workflows-visual-explainer/nodes/`

**How to roll back**: Delete the entire `.opencode/skill/workflows-visual-explainer/` directory.

### Context

The OpenCode skill framework uses naming prefixes to classify skills by type. We needed to decide the correct prefix for the visual-explainer skill. The skill defines a multi-phase workflow (Think > Structure > Style > Deliver) with defined step sequences, which aligns with the `workflows-` convention.

### Constraints

- Existing convention: `workflows-` prefix for process-oriented skills with defined phase sequences
- Existing examples: `workflows-documentation`, `workflows-git`, `workflows-code--opencode`
- Must be discoverable via skill_advisor.py naming patterns
<!-- /ANCHOR:adr-002-context -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:adr-002-decision -->
### Decision

**We chose**: `workflows-visual-explainer` as the skill directory name.

**How it works**: The `workflows-` prefix signals that this skill follows a defined multi-phase process (Think > Structure > Style > Deliver). This matches the naming convention used by other process-oriented skills in the framework.
<!-- /ANCHOR:adr-002-decision -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:adr-002-alternatives -->
### Alternatives Considered

| Option | Pros | Cons | Score |
|--------|------|------|-------|
| **workflows-visual-explainer (chosen)** | Matches convention; signals process orientation | Longer name | 9/10 |
| visual-explainer (no prefix) | Shorter name | Breaks convention; no type signal | 4/10 |
| tools-visual-explainer | Alternative prefix | `tools-` implies utility, not workflow | 5/10 |

**Why this one**: The 4-phase workflow (Think > Structure > Style > Deliver) is the defining characteristic of this skill, making `workflows-` the correct classification.
<!-- /ANCHOR:adr-002-alternatives -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:adr-002-consequences -->
### Consequences

**What improves**:
- Consistent naming with existing skills (workflows-documentation, workflows-git)
- Users and agents can infer the skill type from the prefix

**What it costs**:
- Longer directory path. Mitigation: Tab completion and skill_advisor.py handle discovery.

**Risks**:

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| None significant | L | Convention is well-established |

## ADR-003: Progressive Disclosure via 3-Tier Loading

|-------|-------|
| **Status** | Accepted |
| **Date** | 2025-02-21 |

---

### Context

The skill contains ~46KB of reference material (quick_reference ~4KB, css_patterns ~15KB, library_guide ~16KB, navigation_patterns ~5KB, quality_checklist ~6KB). Loading all references on every skill invocation would consume excessive context window space. We needed a strategy to load only what is needed.

### Constraints

- AI agent context windows have finite capacity
- Most tasks need only the command cheat sheet and CDN snippets
- CSS-heavy tasks need the full CSS pattern library
- Library-specific tasks need the library guide
<!-- /ANCHOR:adr-003-context -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:adr-003-decision -->
### Decision

**We chose**: Three-tier progressive loading: ALWAYS (loaded automatically), CONDITIONAL (loaded when task type matches), ON_DEMAND (loaded only when explicitly needed).

**How it works**: SKILL.md's Smart Router classifies the task and determines which loading tier to activate. quick_reference.md is always loaded. css_patterns.md and navigation_patterns.md load for CSS-heavy or multi-section tasks. library_guide.md and quality_checklist.md load only when specifically requested.
<!-- /ANCHOR:adr-003-decision -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:adr-003-alternatives -->
### Alternatives Considered

| Option | Pros | Cons | Score |
|--------|------|------|-------|
| **3-tier loading (chosen)** | Optimizes context usage; only loads what is needed | Requires Smart Router logic to classify tasks | 9/10 |
| Load all references always | Simple; no classification needed | Wastes ~42KB of context on every invocation | 3/10 |
| Load nothing by default | Maximum context savings | User must manually request each reference | 5/10 |

**Why this one**: The 3-tier approach balances context efficiency with usability. The most common reference (quick_reference.md at ~4KB) is always available, while heavier references (~31KB combined) load only when needed.
<!-- /ANCHOR:adr-003-alternatives -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:adr-003-consequences -->
### Consequences

**What improves**:
- Initial context usage reduced by ~31KB compared to loading all references
- Most common operations (generate, diff-review) work with ALWAYS tier only
- Agents self-serve additional context when needed

**What it costs**:
- Smart Router must correctly classify task types. Mitigation: Fallback to ALWAYS tier if classification is uncertain.

**Risks**:

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Smart Router misclassifies task, loads wrong tier | L | ALWAYS tier covers most cases; agent can manually load additional references |

## ADR-004: MULTI_SKILL_BOOSTERS for Conflicting Keywords

---

### Context

Several keywords relevant to the visual-explainer skill (diagram, flowchart, review, architecture, data) already exist in skill_advisor.py's INTENT_BOOSTERS mapped to other skills. Adding them as INTENT_BOOSTERS for workflows-visual-explainer would overwrite the existing mappings and break routing for other skills.

### Constraints

- INTENT_BOOSTERS uses a dictionary where each keyword maps to exactly one skill
- Keywords like "diagram", "flowchart", "review" are already mapped to other skills
- Cannot break existing skill routing for these keywords
<!-- /ANCHOR:adr-004-context -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:adr-004-decision -->
### Decision

**We chose**: Use MULTI_SKILL_BOOSTERS for the 5 conflicting keywords (diagram, flowchart, review, architecture, data), and INTENT_BOOSTERS for the 11 unique keywords.

**How it works**: MULTI_SKILL_BOOSTERS allows multiple skills to be boosted by the same keyword. When "diagram" appears in a query, both the existing skill and workflows-visual-explainer get boosted, and the final routing score determines which one wins based on other context signals.
<!-- /ANCHOR:adr-004-decision -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:adr-004-alternatives -->
### Alternatives Considered

| Option | Pros | Cons | Score |
|--------|------|------|-------|
| **MULTI_SKILL_BOOSTERS for conflicts (chosen)** | Preserves existing routing; both skills can match | Slightly more complex routing logic | 9/10 |
| Overwrite INTENT_BOOSTERS | Simpler; direct mapping | Breaks existing skill routing for those keywords | 2/10 |
| Avoid conflicting keywords entirely | No risk to existing routing | Reduces discoverability for common queries | 4/10 |

**Why this one**: MULTI_SKILL_BOOSTERS is the framework's built-in mechanism for exactly this scenario. Using it preserves existing routing while enabling visual-explainer discovery.
<!-- /ANCHOR:adr-004-alternatives -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:adr-004-consequences -->
### Consequences

**What improves**:
- Existing skill routing remains intact for all 5 conflicting keywords
- Visual-explainer becomes discoverable for queries containing these common terms
- Multiple skills can compete fairly on routing score

**What it costs**:
- Routing for ambiguous queries (e.g., just "diagram") may require more context to disambiguate. Mitigation: Visual-explainer-specific keywords in INTENT_BOOSTERS provide strong signal.

**Risks**:

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Ambiguous queries route to wrong skill | L | 11 unique INTENT_BOOSTERS provide strong baseline; MULTI_SKILL_BOOSTERS are secondary |

### Context

The original visual-explainer repo defines 7 quality checks for generated HTML output. During reverse-engineering, we identified two gaps: accessibility (color contrast, semantic HTML, screen reader support) and reduced-motion support (respecting `prefers-reduced-motion` media query). These are standard web quality concerns that the original did not explicitly address.

### Constraints

- Original 7 checks must be preserved exactly (no removal or modification)
- Additional checks must be additive and non-breaking
- validate-html-output.sh must be updated to include the new checks
<!-- /ANCHOR:adr-005-context -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:adr-005-decision -->
### Decision

**We chose**: Add 2 new quality checks (accessibility and reduced-motion) to the original 7, bringing the total to 9.

**How it works**: success-criteria.md documents all 9 checks. quality_checklist.md provides detailed verification steps. validate-html-output.sh includes static checks for both new criteria where feasible (e.g., checking for `prefers-reduced-motion` media query presence).
<!-- /ANCHOR:adr-005-decision -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:adr-005-alternatives -->
### Alternatives Considered

| Option | Pros | Cons | Score |
|--------|------|------|-------|
| **Add 2 checks (chosen)** | Covers important accessibility gap; non-breaking | Slightly more verification work | 9/10 |
| Keep original 7 only | Exact parity with source | Misses accessibility and reduced-motion | 6/10 |
| Add 5+ additional checks | More comprehensive | Over-engineering for initial release; diminishing returns | 5/10 |

**Why this one**: Accessibility and reduced-motion are high-impact, low-effort additions that address real gaps in the original. Adding more checks would be speculative.
<!-- /ANCHOR:adr-005-alternatives -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:adr-005-consequences -->
### Consequences

**What improves**:
- Generated HTML is more accessible by default
- Animations respect user motion preferences
- Quality bar is higher than the original with minimal added complexity

**What it costs**:
- Agents must verify 9 checks instead of 7. Mitigation: The 2 new checks are straightforward and fast.

**Risks**:

### Context

Reference files were initially created with kebab-case filenames (e.g., `quick-reference.md`, `css-patterns.md`). package_skill.py validation rejected these filenames, requiring snake_case (e.g., `quick_reference.md`, `css_patterns.md`).

### Constraints

- package_skill.py enforces snake_case for reference files
- Validation must PASS for the skill to be considered valid
- Node files use kebab-case (different convention, validated differently)
<!-- /ANCHOR:adr-006-context -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:adr-006-decision -->
### Decision

**We chose**: Rename all reference files from kebab-case to snake_case before final validation.

**How it works**: All 5 reference files use snake_case: `quick_reference.md`, `css_patterns.md`, `library_guide.md`, `navigation_patterns.md`, `quality_checklist.md`. This passes package_skill.py validation.
<!-- /ANCHOR:adr-006-decision -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:adr-006-alternatives -->
### Alternatives Considered

| Option | Pros | Cons | Score |
|--------|------|------|-------|
| **snake_case (chosen)** | Passes validation; follows convention | Inconsistent with node file naming | 9/10 |
| Keep kebab-case | Consistent with node naming | Fails package_skill.py validation | 2/10 |

**Why this one**: package_skill.py validation is a hard gate. snake_case is required for references regardless of other naming conventions.
<!-- /ANCHOR:adr-006-alternatives -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:adr-006-consequences -->
### Consequences

**What improves**:
- package_skill.py validation passes cleanly
- Reference filenames follow the enforced convention

**What it costs**:
- Slight naming inconsistency between nodes (kebab-case) and references (snake_case). Mitigation: This is a framework convention, not a project decision.

### Context

The original repo contains 3 production-quality HTML templates (architecture, mermaid-flowchart, data-table) totaling ~46KB. These templates use specific color schemes, CSS Grid layouts, and CDN library integrations. We needed to decide whether to port them as-is or modify them for the OpenCode context.

### Constraints

- Templates are production-quality exemplars (not boilerplate)
- They demonstrate specific aesthetic profiles (terracotta/sage, teal/cyan, rose/cranberry)
- Modifications risk breaking working templates without adding value
- MIT license permits use without modification
<!-- /ANCHOR:adr-007-context -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:adr-007-decision -->
### Decision

**We chose**: Port all 3 HTML templates as-is from the original repo, without modification.

**How it works**: Templates are placed in `assets/templates/` and serve as exemplars that agents can reference when generating new visual explainers. They demonstrate best practices for structure, styling, and library integration.

| Modify and customize | Tailored to OpenCode conventions | Risk breaking working templates; significant effort | 5/10 |
| Create new templates from scratch | Fully custom | Massive effort; loses proven quality | 3/10 |

**Why this one**: The templates are production-quality exemplars. Modifying them risks introducing bugs without adding meaningful value. They work as reference implementations.

### Consequences

**What improves**:
- Zero regression risk on template quality
- Agents have proven, working exemplars to reference

### Context

The original visual-explainer repo outputs generated HTML to `~/.agent/diagrams/`, a user-home directory. In the OpenCode framework, skills should produce output in project-local directories to maintain portability and avoid polluting the user's home directory.

### Constraints

- OpenCode convention: output stays within the project directory

<!-- ANCHOR:adr-008-decision -->
### Decision

**We chose**: Output generated HTML to `.opencode/output/visual/` within the project directory.

**How it works**: All generated visual explainer HTML files are written to `.opencode/output/visual/`. The cleanup-output.sh script manages this directory. This keeps output project-local and follows the `.opencode/` convention for framework-managed files.

- cleanup-output.sh can manage the directory
- Users can find output in a predictable location

**What it costs**:
- Adds files to the project directory. Mitigation: `.opencode/output/` should be in `.gitignore`.

**Risks**:

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Output directory grows large over time | L | cleanup-output.sh provides automated maintenance |

### Five Checks Evaluation

| # | Check | Result | Evidence |
|---|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | **Necessary?** | PASS | Must define output location; original path violates convention |
| 2 | **Beyond Local Maxima?** | PASS | 3 options considered |
| 3 | **Sufficient?** | PASS | Single directory with cleanup script |
| 4 | **Fits Goal?** | PASS | Follows OpenCode conventions |
| 5 | **Open Horizons?** | PASS | Path can be configured if needed in future |

**Checks Summary**: 5/5 PASS

<!-- ANCHOR:adr-008-impl -->
### Implementation

**What changes**:
- SKILL.md and commands reference `.opencode/output/visual/` as output directory
- `scripts/cleanup-output.sh` manages this directory
- Documented in nodes/integration-points.md

**How to roll back**: Change output path references back to `~/.agent/diagrams/`.

### Context

The source repository (nicobailon/visual-explainer v0.1.1) relies on surf-cli for placeholder image generation. surf-cli is an external headless browser dependency that may not be available in all environments — it requires a system-level installation and network access to function. During gap analysis, this was classified as gap C1 (Critical) because the dependency blocks a core use case in environments where surf-cli is absent.

### Constraints

- surf-cli requires a separate system installation outside the OpenCode framework
- Not all CI/CD environments or developer machines have surf-cli available
- Placeholder images are used for layout demonstration, not final output
- CSS gradients and geometric shapes are sufficient fidelity for placeholder purposes
<!-- /ANCHOR:adr-009-context -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:adr-009-decision -->
### Decision

**We chose**: CSS-first placeholder generation using CSS gradients, geometric shapes, and `background-image` patterns as a drop-in replacement for surf-cli-generated images.

**How it works**: Placeholder image areas in generated HTML use CSS `background` properties (linear-gradient, radial-gradient, repeating-linear-gradient) to render colored geometric shapes that visually indicate image zones. These render in any browser without external dependencies. The patterns are documented in css_patterns.md and available to agents generating visual explainer output.

### Alternatives Considered

| Option | Pros | Cons | Score |
|--------|------|------|-------|
| **CSS-first placeholders (chosen)** | No external deps; reproducible; zero cost; works everywhere | Less photorealistic than AI-generated images | 9/10 |
| Keep surf-cli dependency | Matches source repo exactly; higher visual fidelity | Breaks in environments without surf-cli; non-portable | 3/10 |
| External image API (e.g., picsum.photos) | Simple; photorealistic placeholders | Requires network access; introduces external dependency; potential cost | 5/10 |

**Why this one**: CSS-first approach eliminates all external dependencies, ensuring the skill works in any environment. Placeholder fidelity is sufficient for layout demonstration purposes, which is the primary use case.

### Consequences

**What improves**:
- Skill works in any environment without additional installation steps
- No network calls for placeholder generation
- Zero API cost; no rate limits or keys required
- Output is fully deterministic and reproducible

**What it costs**:
- Placeholders are geometric/gradient-based, not photorealistic. Mitigation: Placeholder zones are clearly labeled with text overlays indicating the image intent; users replace them with real assets for final output.

**Risks**:

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Users expect photorealistic placeholders matching source repo | L | Document the design choice in skill notes; CSS patterns are clearly labeled as placeholders |

### Five Checks Evaluation

| # | Check | Result | Evidence |
|---|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | **Necessary?** | PASS | surf-cli creates a hard environmental dependency that blocks portability |
| 2 | **Beyond Local Maxima?** | PASS | 3 options considered (CSS-first, keep surf-cli, external API) |
| 3 | **Sufficient?** | PASS | CSS gradients provide adequate visual fidelity for placeholder use cases |
| 4 | **Fits Goal?** | PASS | Eliminates C1 Critical gap while preserving skill functionality |
| 5 | **Open Horizons?** | PASS | Users can substitute real images; CSS patterns can be enhanced without breaking changes |

**Checks Summary**: 5/5 PASS
<!-- /ANCHOR:adr-009-five-checks -->

<!-- ANCHOR:adr-009-impl -->
### Implementation

**What changes**:
- CSS placeholder patterns documented in `references/css_patterns.md` (gap C1 remediation)
- SKILL.md Smart Router updated to reference CSS-first approach for image placeholder use cases
- surf-cli removed from dependencies and from `nodes/integration-points.md`

**How to roll back**: Re-add surf-cli as a dependency in integration-points.md and replace CSS placeholder patterns with surf-cli invocations in generated output.
