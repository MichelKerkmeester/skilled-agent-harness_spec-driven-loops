# Plan: Aggressive @context_loader Enforcement

> **Spec Folder:** `.opencode/specs/004-agents/008-context-loader-enforcement/`

<!-- ANCHOR:summary -->
## 1. Approach

Full audit of all agent and command files, applying the aggressive enforcement rule from spec.md §3. Each @explore reference is classified as KEEP (rule-compliant) or REPLACE (should be @context_loader).

## 2. Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Audit
- Search ALL agent files for `@explore` / `explore` references
- Search ALL command files in both `.claude/commands/` and `.opencode/command/`
- Deep-read orchestrate.md's 9 "intentional" references in full surrounding context

### Phase 2: Classify
- Apply the enforcement rule to each reference
- Categorize as KEEP or REPLACE with rationale

### Phase 3: Apply
- Make all REPLACE changes
- Verify no regressions

### Phase 4: Document
- Update tasks.md with results
- Create implementation-summary.md
