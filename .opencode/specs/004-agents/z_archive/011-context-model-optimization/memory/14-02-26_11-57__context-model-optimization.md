<!-- Constitutional Tier Promotion:
  To promote a memory to constitutional tier (always surfaced):
  
  1. Via MCP tool after indexing:
     memory_update({ id: <memory_id>, importanceTier: 'constitutional' })
  
  2. Criteria for constitutional:
     - Applies to ALL future conversations (not project-specific)
     - Core constraints/rules that should NEVER be forgotten
     - ~2000 token budget total for constitutional tier
     
  3. Add trigger phrases for proactive surfacing:
     memory_update({ 
       id: <memory_id>, 
       importanceTier: 'constitutional',
       triggerPhrases: ['fix', 'implement', 'create', 'modify', ...]
     })
     
  4. Examples of constitutional content:
     - "Always ask Gate 3 spec folder question before file modifications"
     - "Never modify production data directly"
     - "Memory files MUST use generate-context.js script"

### Context Summary

**Phase:** IMPLEMENTATION

**Recent:** Tool: todowrite, Tool: sequential_thinking_sequentialthinking, Tool: sequential_thinking_sequentialthinking

**Summary:** Good. Let me start Phase 1 (bug fix) and the golden reference prep in parallel. First I need to read the spec_kit pattern files as concrete reference, and fix the step count bugs simultaneously.

### Pending Work

- No pending tasks - session completed successfully

### Quick Resume

**To continue this work, use:**
```
/spec_kit:resume ../.opencode/specs/004-agents/011-context-model-optimization
```

**Or paste this continuation prompt:**
```
CONTINUATION - Attempt 2
Spec: ../.opencode/specs/004-agents/011-context-model-optimization
Last: Tool: sequential_thinking_sequentialthinking
Next: Continue implementation
```

**Key Context to Review:**

- Files modified: .opencode/command/create/assets/create_agent.yaml, CHANGELOG.md

- Last: Now I can see the style difference. The GitHub release for v2.0.1.0 uses:
- Bold

## 3. DETAILED CHANGES

<!-- ANCHOR:implementation-now-see-style-difference-143ed965 -->
### FEATURE: Now I can see the style difference. The GitHub release for v2.0.1.0 uses:
- Bold

Now I can see the style difference. The GitHub release for v2.0.1.0 uses:
- Bold intro paragraph
- `## Highlights` with emoji H3 headers (`### emoji Title`)
- Narrative "What changed" style with bullet lists (dash `-`, not numbered)
- `## Files Changed`, `## Upgrade` sections at the bottom
- No numbered items in sections

The CHANGELOG uses numbered items. Let me update both. First, restyle the CHANGELOG entry:

Let me pick up where we left off. The next step is to **complete the systematic vulnerability assessment** of the 6 create commands against the 5 fixes (A-E) from Spec 118. I have all the files read from the previous session — now I need to finish the Sequential Thinking analysis.

Let me resume that analysis and also check the current state of things.

Good question — we hardened the security but didn't validate whether the YAML files still parse correctly or whether the integration between `.md` ↔ `.yaml` is solid. Let me check.

### FEATURE: You're right — there's a real tension in the wording. The YAML files ARE loaded 

You're right — there's a real tension in the wording. The YAML files ARE loaded and executed (by the parent `.md` command), so calling them "REFERENCE ONLY" sounds like we're saying "don't execute these" — which contradicts the whole "load YAML and execute" instruction.

The actual comment we added says it correctly: *"This file is loaded and executed **by the parent command file**. Do not treat this content as standalone instructions."* — but the release notes shorthand loses that nuance.

## Goal

Fix **command dispatch vulnerabilities** across ALL command files in the OpenCode framework, **align styles** with sk-documentation standards, and **publish releases** on GitHub main. This is a multi-spec effort:

1. **Spec 118** (v2.0.1.1) — Fixed 7 spec_kit commands ✅ COMPLETE (prior session)
2. **Spec 008** (v2.0.1.2) — Fixed 6 create commands ✅ COMPLETE (this session)
3. **Future spec** — Memory commands + agent_router.md 🔴 NOT STARTED

Looking at the remaining work, there are clear next steps:

1. **Memory comman

Looking at the remaining work, there are clear next steps:

1. **Memory commands vulnerability assessment** (5 files)
2. **`agent_router.md` vulnerability assessment** (1 file)
3. **Orphaned `create_agent.yaml` cleanup**
4. **Spec 008 `implementation-summary.md`**

Let me start by tackling the most impactful items in parallel. I'll assess the memory commands and agent_router.md for the same phantom dispatch vulnerability, and simultaneously create the missing implementation-summary for Spec 00

### FEATURE: Got it — you're talking about the **anobel.com project's** Claude commands at `.

Got it — you're talking about the **anobel.com project's** Claude commands at `.claude/commands/create/`, not the Public repo's OpenCode commands. These need proper YAML workflow integration like spec_kit has. Let me explore what exists there first.

Based on the handover context, the next steps are clear: complete the **v2.0.1.4 release**. The CHANGELOG entry is written and staged, the YAML files are edited — all that remains is the git commit, tag, push, and GitHub release.

Full refactor it is. Before I start, one Gate 3 question:

**Spec Folder:**
- **A)** Extend Spec 008 with a sub-folder `002-create-architecture-refactor/` (continuation of create command work)
- **B)** New spec (e.g., `009-create-yaml-architecture/`) 
- **D)** Skip documentation

And a quick execution approach confirmation — given the scale (~24-30 files), I'll use a **golden reference strategy**:

1. **Phase 1** — Fix the 3 step-count bugs immediately
2. **Phase 2+3+4** — Refactor `skill.md` +

## RECOVERY HINTS

**Diagnostic guidance for common session recovery scenarios.**

### Recovery Scenarios

| Scenario | Symptoms | Recovery Action |
|----------|----------|-----------------|
| Context Loss | Agent doesn't remember prior work | Run `/spec_kit:resume ../.opencode/specs/004-agents/011-context-model-optimization` |
| State Mismatch | Files don't match expected state | Verify with `git status` and `git diff` |
| Memory Not Found | Search returns no results | Check `memory_search({ specFolder: "../.opencode/specs/004-agents/011-context-model-optimization" })` |
| Stale Context | Information seems outdated | Check `last_accessed_epoch` vs current time |
| Incomplete Handover | Missing continuation context | Review CONTINUE SESSION section above |
| Dedup Collision | Wrong memory surfaced | Check `fingerprint_hash` for conflicts |

### Diagnostic Commands

```bash
# Check memory index health
node .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/lib/storage/checkpoints.ts --status

# List memories for this spec folder
memory_search({ specFolder: "../.opencode/specs/004-agents/011-context-model-optimization", limit: 10 })

# Verify memory file integrity
ls -la ../.opencode/specs/004-agents/011-context-model-optimization/memory/

# Check for orphaned memories
memory_search({ query: "orphaned", anchors: ["state"] })

# Force re-index of this spec folder
node .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/dist/memory/generate-context.js ../.opencode/specs/004-agents/011-context-model-optimization --force
```

### Recovery Priority

1. **Verify spec folder exists** - Check path is correct
2. **Load memory context** - Use memory_search to surface prior work
3. **Review last session state** - Check PROJECT STATE SNAPSHOT
4. **Validate pending tasks** - Review CONTINUE SESSION section
5. **Resume with handover prompt** - Use continuation template above

### Session Integrity Checks

| Check | Status | Details |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Memory File Exists |  |  |
| Index Entry Valid |  | Last indexed:  |
| Checksums Match |  |  |
| No Dedup Conflicts |  |  |

## POSTFLIGHT LEARNING DELTA

**Epistemic state comparison showing knowledge gained during session.**

<!-- Delta Calculation Formulas:
  DELTA_KNOW_SCORE = POSTFLIGHT_KNOW_SCORE - PREFLIGHT_KNOW_SCORE (positive = improvement)
  DELTA_UNCERTAINTY_SCORE = PREFLIGHT_UNCERTAINTY_SCORE - POSTFLIGHT_UNCERTAINTY_SCORE (positive = reduction, which is good)
  DELTA_CONTEXT_SCORE = POSTFLIGHT_CONTEXT_SCORE - PREFLIGHT_CONTEXT_SCORE (positive = improvement)
  DELTA_*_TREND = "↑" if delta > 0, "↓" if delta < 0, "→" if delta == 0
-->

| Metric | Before | After | Delta | Trend |
|--------|--------|-------|-------|-------|
| Knowledge | [TBD] | [TBD] | [TBD] | → |
| Uncertainty | [TBD] | [TBD] | [TBD] | → |
| Context | [TBD] | [TBD] | [TBD] | → |

**Learning Index:** [TBD]/100

> Learning Index = (Knowledge Delta × 0.4) + (Uncertainty Reduction × 0.35) + (Context Improvement × 0.25)
> Higher is better. Target: ≥25 for productive sessions.

**Gaps Closed:**

- No gaps explicitly closed during session

**New Gaps Discovered:**

- No new gaps discovered

**Session Learning Summary:**
Learning metrics will be calculated when both preflight and postflight data are provided.
