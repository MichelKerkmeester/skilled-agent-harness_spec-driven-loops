## What Was Built

### Phase 1: NDP Addition (Initial Implementation)

Added the Nesting Depth Protocol (NDP) as new Section 26 to all three orchestrate.md variants (base, chatgpt, copilot). The NDP introduces a 3-tier agent classification system (ORCHESTRATOR/DISPATCHER/LEAF) with an absolute maximum dispatch depth of 3 levels (depth 0-1-2). Every dispatch template now includes a `Depth` field and tier-appropriate enforcement instructions. Two new anti-patterns were added to Section 24, and the Section 11 conditional branching nesting language was clarified to avoid confusion with agent dispatch nesting.

### Phase 2: Full Restructure (27 sections to 10 sections)

Restructured all three orchestrate.md variants from 27 scattered sections into 10 cohesive sections organized around the orchestrator's actual decision loop. NDP moved from buried §26 to prominent §2. Budget sections (CWB, TCB, resource budgeting) consolidated from 3 scattered locations into single §8. Anti-patterns condensed from 12 to 6 (removed items that merely restated existing rules). Removed 6 aspirational sections with no runtime backing (Event-Driven Triggers, Saga Compensation, Caching Layer, Checkpointing, Summary, Mermaid Visualization). Promoted copilot-unique improvements (expanded Rule 2 verification gates, Rule 6 routing violation detection) to all variants.

### Phase 3: Semantic Emoji Alignment

Added 7 semantic emojis aligned with context.md and workflows-documentation conventions:
- `#### ✅ Legal Nesting Chains` / `#### ❌ Illegal Nesting Chains`
- `### 🔒 Agent Loading Protocol (MANDATORY)` / `#### 🔒 LEAF Enforcement Instruction` / `#### 🔒 DISPATCHER Enforcement Instruction`
- `### 🔒 Review Checklist (MANDATORY)` / `### ❌ Rejection Criteria`

### Phase 4: Skill Reference Wildcard

Replaced all `workflows-code--web-dev` / `sk-code--full-stack` specific references with `workflows-code--*` wildcard pattern for auto-detection of any available variant. Applied across 6 agent files (3 orchestrate.md + 3 review.md variants).

### Phase 5: Claude Code Agent Sync

Duplicated all 8 copilot agent files to `.claude/agents/` with Claude Code (CC) frontmatter format:
- OpenCode `permission` object → CC `tools` list (allowed tools only)
- OpenCode `model: github-copilot/claude-*` → CC `model: opus|sonnet|haiku`
- Added `mcpServers: [spec_kit_memory, code_mode]` to all CC agents
- Removed OpenCode-specific fields (`mode`, `temperature`, `reasoningEffort`)

<!-- ANCHOR:decisions -->
## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| 3-tier classification (ORCHESTRATOR/DISPATCHER/LEAF) | Preserves @context dispatch while preventing unbounded nesting |
| Absolute max depth of 3 (depth 0-1-2) | Tightest limit that accommodates all valid workflows |
| Depth field in every dispatch | Makes depth visible and enforceable at every level |
| 27→10 section restructure | Organized around actual decision loop; removed bloat and scattered content |
| Remove 6 aspirational sections | No runtime implementation backed them; dead weight in the document |
| Condense anti-patterns 12→6 | Removed items that merely restated existing rules |
| Promote copilot Rule 2 + Rule 6 to all variants | Genuinely useful enforcement, not copilot-specific |
| Semantic emojis only | Aligned with context.md patterns: ✅/❌/🔒 on subsections, never on H2 headers |
| `workflows-code--*` wildcard | Auto-detects any available workflows-code variant instead of hardcoding specific names |
| CC agent sync from copilot | Copilot has latest body content; CC frontmatter preserved for Claude Code compatibility |

<!-- ANCHOR:verification -->
## Verification

| Test Type | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Cross-reference | Pass | Zero stale §N references (old §9-§27 absent from restructured files) |
| Variant parity | Pass | Base vs ChatGPT: byte-identical; Base vs Copilot: 2-line frontmatter difference only |
| Section count | Pass | Exactly 10 `## N.` section headers per file |
| Tier coverage | Pass | All 11 agents have Tier assignments in §2 routing table |
| Emoji alignment | Pass | 7 semantic emojis added, all consistent with context.md vocabulary |
| NDP integrity | Pass | Legal chains (4 examples), illegal chains (4 examples) preserved with ✅/❌ markers |
| Wildcard refs | Pass | Zero `workflows-code--web-dev` / `--full-stack` references remain in any agent file |
| CC sync | Pass | All 8 .claude/agents/ files have CC frontmatter + copilot body content |

<!-- ANCHOR:limitations -->
## Known Limitations

- Enforcement is instruction-based only (no runtime tooling) — depends on model compliance
- Codex-specific behavioral tendencies may require additional prompting beyond NDP rules
- Future spec may add runtime depth enforcement via code
