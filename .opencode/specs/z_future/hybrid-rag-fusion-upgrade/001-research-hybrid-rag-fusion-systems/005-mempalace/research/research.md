## 2. Role

You are a research specialist in verbatim AI memory systems, ChromaDB-based semantic retrieval, navigable memory taxonomies, wake-up context layering, MCP tool design, hook-driven persistence, and local temporal knowledge graphs. Work like a systems analyst who can separate README positioning from verified Python mechanics, trace how MemPalace composes mining, storage, retrieval, hooks, and protocol guidance, and translate those choices into practical improvements for `Code_Environment/Public`.

## 3. Task

Research MemPalace's raw-verbatim memory architecture, palace taxonomy, wake-up stack, MCP protocol/tooling, hook-driven save flow, and temporal knowledge-graph patterns to identify practical, evidence-backed improvements for `Code_Environment/Public`, especially around session continuity, compaction survival, memory hygiene, and agent-facing recall ergonomics. Determine which MemPalace ideas should be `adopt now`, `prototype later`, or `reject`. Keep the analysis honest about what is source-confirmed, what is README-documented, and what is benchmark-claim territory.

## 4. Context

### 4.1 System Description

MemPalace is a local Python memory system centered on a strong design claim: keep raw conversation and project text instead of extracting only summarized facts, then make that verbatim corpus searchable and navigable. The external repo exposes a CLI, an MCP server, hook scripts, a ChromaDB-backed drawer store, a wake-up layering system, and a separate SQLite temporal knowledge graph. Its storage model uses palace terminology: wings for people/projects/topics, halls for shared memory categories, rooms for named ideas, closets for compact summaries, and drawers for original verbatim content.

The most important architectural tension in this phase is that MemPalace mixes strong implementation ideas with aggressive README claims that the project itself partially corrects in its April 7, 2026 note. The raw-verbatim result is the standout claim; AAAK is explicitly experimental and lossy; contradiction detection is documented as incomplete; and some benchmark or rerank claims live more in docs than in source. This phase should reward the underlying architecture where the code supports it, but it must not let benchmark marketing or future-looking README language blur the evidence line.

The repo appears to support three ingestion shapes into one shared memory backend: project mining, conversation mining, and a general heuristic extraction mode. Retrieval then spans direct semantic search, wake-up text generation across L0-L3 layers, palace graph traversal via shared room metadata, and MCP tooling that teaches an operational memory protocol to the agent through the status response itself. Hook scripts add another layer: instead of a memory system that only responds to explicit search/save calls, MemPalace also tries to shape the timing of memory writes at stop and pre-compact boundaries.

### 4.2 Cross-Phase Awareness Table

| Phase | System | Core Pattern | Overlap Risk | Differentiation |
|-------|--------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|
| 001 | Engram | MCP memory server (Go, SQLite+FTS5) | 005 (memory server), 004 (session continuity) | Focus tool profiles, session lifecycle, topic keys |
| 002 | Mex | Markdown scaffold + drift detection | 005 (project knowledge) | Focus drift detection, scaffold structure, no-DB approach |
| 003 | Modus Memory | FSRS spaced repetition + BM25 | 005 (local memory) | Focus FSRS decay, BM25, librarian expansion, cross-references |
| 004 | OpenCode Mnemosyne | Hybrid search (FTS5 + vector) | 005 (compaction, hybrid retrieval claims) | Focus plugin architecture, project/global scoping, wrapper boundary |
| 005 | MemPalace | Raw verbatim storage + palace taxonomy + hooks + temporal KG | 001 (MCP memory), 004 (compaction/helping memory survive), 003 (local memory) | Focus raw-no-extraction posture, wake-up layers, hooks, palace structure, temporal KG |

### 4.3 What This Repo Already Has

`Code_Environment/Public` already has Spec Kit Memory with hybrid retrieval, `memory_search`, `memory_context`, `memory_match_triggers`, memory-save flows through `generate-context.js`, session/bootstrap handling in the memory MCP server, and compaction-oriented structural transport via `.opencode/plugins/spec-kit-compact-code-graph.js`. It also already has semantic code search via CocoIndex and structured graph context via Compact Code Graph.

What it does **not** currently have is a raw-verbatim-by-default memory posture comparable to MemPalace's drawer model, a first-class wing/hall/room taxonomy for agent memory navigation, a dedicated L0/L1/L2/L3 wake-up stack for context loading, MemPalace-style stop/pre-compact save hooks that actively block to force preservation, or a separate temporal entity-triple knowledge graph with explicit invalidation alongside the main memory store. The comparison should stay anchored to those gaps rather than repeating generic hybrid-RAG analysis already covered elsewhere.

## 5. Instructions

1. Treat `/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace` as the pre-approved phase folder. Skip Gate 3, keep all writes inside this phase folder, and treat everything under `external/` as read-only.
2. Read the governing Public repo `AGENTS.md` first. Then explicitly verify whether `external/AGENTS.md` exists. If it does not, note that absence as evidence about repo scope rather than inventing external workflow constraints.
3. Before deep research begins, ensure this phase folder contains Level 3 Spec Kit docs: `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`, `checklist.md`, and `decision-record.md`.
4. Use `@speckit` for markdown authoring when the runtime supports agent routing. If routing is unavailable, preserve existing Spec Kit Level 3 structure manually without creating side-channel docs outside the phase folder.
5. Start with `external/README.md`, but read it critically. Cover these sections in order: the April 7, 2026 correction note; Quick Start; How You Actually Use It; The Palace; wake-up / AAAK sections; MCP tools; benchmark sections. Capture both the architecture claims and the repo's own admitted overstatements.
6. Immediately after the README, read `external/pyproject.toml` and `external/mempalace/cli.py`. Confirm the actual runtime boundary, command surface, install assumptions, and the core flows for `init`, `mine`, `search`, `wake-up`, `status`, `repair`, and `compress`.
7. Trace the MCP surface end to end in `external/mempalace/mcp_server.py`. Focus on tool registration, read/write split, stderr logging behavior, `PALACE_PROTOCOL`, `AAAK_SPEC`, status bootstrap behavior, duplicate checking, graph tools, knowledge-graph tools, diary tools, and what the tool names imply about agent discipline.
8. Trace retrieval and context loading next in `external/mempalace/searcher.py` and `external/mempalace/layers.py`. Capture the raw ChromaDB query path, wing/room filtering, L0/L1/L2/L3 layering, wake-up token assumptions, and how much of that layering is implementation versus README framing.
9. Trace structural navigation next in `external/mempalace/palace_graph.py` and `external/mempalace/knowledge_graph.py`. Keep these separate in your notes: palace graph traversal is metadata-derived from ChromaDB rooms/halls/wings, while the knowledge graph is a separate SQLite temporal triple store with invalidation.
