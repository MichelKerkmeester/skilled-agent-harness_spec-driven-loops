### Finding 4: Mnemosyne’s deletion flow is hard-delete by opaque numeric ID from plain-text recall output
- **Source**: [external/src/index.ts:104](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/004-opencode-mnemosyne-main/external/src/index.ts#L104), [external/src/index.ts:114](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/004-opencode-mnemosyne-main/external/src/index.ts#L114), [external/src/index.ts:193](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/004-opencode-mnemosyne-main/external/src/index.ts#L193), [external/README.md:45](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/004-opencode-mnemosyne-main/external/README.md#L45), [memory-crud-delete.ts:91](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/handlers/memory-crud-delete.ts#L91), [memory-bulk-delete.ts:141](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/handlers/memory-bulk-delete.ts#L141), [mutation-ledger.ts:89](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/lib/storage/mutation-ledger.ts#L89)
- **What it does**: Wrapper-confirmed, Mnemosyne recalls with `--format plain`, expects IDs in bracketed text, and deletes by raw numeric document ID. Public delete paths are transactional, record history, clean causal edges, append to an immutable mutation ledger, and can checkpoint bulk cleanup first.
- **Why it matters for us**: Mnemosyne’s flow is simple for humans but weak for safe automation, auditability, and traceable rollbacks. Any future external-binary adapter would need richer envelopes than plain text.
- **Recommendation**: prototype later
- **Impact**: high

### Finding 5: The compaction hook is Mnemosyne’s best hygiene idea, but it is guidance-only
- **Source**: [external/src/index.ts:208](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/004-opencode-mnemosyne-main/external/src/index.ts#L208), [spec-kit-compact-code-graph.js:396](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/plugins/spec-kit-compact-code-graph.js#L396), [context-server.ts:755](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/context-server.ts#L755)
- **What it does**: Wrapper-confirmed, Mnemosyne injects a compact “Persistent Memory” block during `experimental.session.compacting` that reminds the agent when to recall, store, delete contradicted entries, use `core`, and use global scope. Public’s compaction plugin injects transport content blocks, while server instructions advertise key tools but do not inject the same direct memory-discipline checklist into compaction.
- **Why it matters for us**: This is the most transferable hygiene improvement in the external repo. It does not improve mutation correctness by itself, but it likely improves agent behavior after context resets at very low cost.
- **Recommendation**: adopt now
- **Impact**: medium

### Finding 6: Mnemosyne’s wrapper shows no garbage collection or soft-delete lifecycle, while Public already has both
- **Source**: [external/src/index.ts:78](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/004-opencode-mnemosyne-main/external/src/index.ts#L78), [external/src/index.ts:138](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/004-opencode-mnemosyne-main/external/src/index.ts#L138), [external/src/index.ts:193](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/004-opencode-mnemosyne-main/external/src/index.ts#L193), [vector-index-schema.ts:2333](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/lib/search/vector-index-schema.ts#L2333), [scope-governance.ts:221](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/lib/governance/scope-governance.ts#L221), [vector-index-queries.ts:224](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/lib/search/vector-index-queries.ts#L224), [archival-manager.ts:558](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/lib/cognitive/archival-manager.ts#L558), [archival-manager.ts:670](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/lib/cognitive/archival-manager.ts#L670)
- **What it does**: Wrapper-confirmed, Mnemosyne’s visible lifecycle is `init`, `search`, `add`, and `delete`; there is no wrapper-level archive, unarchive, expiry, or sweep behavior. Public persists `retention_policy`, `delete_after`, and `expires_at`, excludes expired or archived rows at query time, and runs archive/unarchive plus background archival scans.
- **Why it matters for us**: For hygiene, Mnemosyne is not a lifecycle-management upgrade over Public. If we ever front an external binary, we would need an adapter that preserves Public’s retention and soft-delete semantics.
- **Recommendation**: reject
- **Impact**: high

## Assessment
- New information ratio: 0.90
- Questions addressed: dedup/upsert behavior, revision tracking, delete semantics, garbage collection, soft deletes, topic key stability, compaction hygiene guidance, auditability of mutation flows
- Questions answered: Mnemosyne’s wrapper exposes no dedup, no upsert, no revision lineage, no soft-delete lifecycle, and no retention/GC contract; contradiction hygiene is primarily agent guidance plus hard delete; basename-derived project scoping is materially less stable than Public’s canonical-path plus logical-key approach; the compaction reminder block is the only clear hygiene improvement worth borrowing immediately; the exact strict validation command returned `RESULT: PASSED` with the warning `cannot create temp file for here document: Operation not permitted`

## Reflection
- What worked: starting with `external/src/index.ts` made the hygiene boundary obvious, then tracing Public’s save, lineage, history, ledger, archival, and query filters showed exactly where Mnemosyne is thinner
- What did not work: the external repo is intentionally minimal, so many lifecycle questions stop at wrapper absence rather than deeper source proof; this sandbox is read-only, so I could not update `research/research.md`, `checklist.md`, `implementation-summary.md`, or run `generate-context.js` to save phase memory

## Recommended Next Focus
Trace the adapter requirements for a future external-binary facade: what response envelope, stable scope key, supersede/archive mapping, mutation audit trail, and delete safety layer would be required so an Mnemosyne-style plugin could preserve Public-grade hygiene instead of collapsing down to plain-text recall and hard-delete-by-ID.

RESEARCH BRIEF:
# $refine TIDD-EC Prompt: 004-opencode-mnemosyne-main

## 2. Role

You are a research specialist in hybrid search architectures (BM25 + vector embeddings), OpenCode plugin design, memory scoping patterns, and session compaction resilience. Work like a systems analyst who can separate TypeScript wrapper behavior from backend README claims, trace plugin lifecycle and hook wiring precisely, and translate OpenCode Mnemosyne's concrete design into practical improvements for `Code_Environment/Public`.

## 3. Task

Research OpenCode Mnemosyne's hybrid search architecture, plugin design patterns, and compaction survival strategies to identify practical, evidence-backed improvements for `Code_Environment/Public`, especially around combining text and vector search, OpenCode plugin integration, project-vs-global memory scoping, and preserving memory awareness across context compaction. Focus on what the external repo actually proves in `src/index.ts` and what the README describes about the Mnemosyne backend. Classify each recommendation as `adopt now`, `prototype later`, or `reject`.

## 4. Context

### 4.1 System Description

OpenCode Mnemosyne is an OpenCode plugin that wraps the Go-based Mnemosyne local memory backend. The external repo is intentionally thin: `src/index.ts` contains the plugin entry point, CLI bridge, tool registration, scope initialization, and the `experimental.session.compacting` hook, while `README.md` describes the backend's hybrid retrieval model and intended agent workflow. The documented retrieval stack combines full-text search (SQLite FTS5 with BM25 ranking) and vector search (sqlite-vec cosine similarity using `snowflake-arctic-embed-m-v1.5`), then fuses both with Reciprocal Rank Fusion. All inference is local, the ML model is downloaded on first use (~500 MB), and no cloud APIs are involved.

The plugin exposes five memory tools: `memory_recall`, `memory_recall_global`, `memory_store`, `memory_store_global`, and `memory_delete`. Project scope is derived from the current directory name and auto-initialized during plugin load; the global collection is initialized lazily on first global write. The wrapper shells out to the `mnemosyne` binary via `Bun.spawn`, quotes search strings to avoid FTS syntax issues, and injects compact memory-usage guidance into the compaction prompt so agents retain memory awareness after context resets.

### 4.2 Cross-Phase Awareness Table

| Phase | System | Core Pattern | Overlap Risk | Differentiation |
|-------|--------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|
| 001 | Engram | MCP memory server (Go, SQLite+FTS5) | 004 (FTS5 search) | Focus tool profiles, session lifecycle, topic keys |
| 002 | Mex | Markdown scaffold + drift detection | 004 (memory) | Focus drift detection, scaffold, no-DB approach |
| 003 | Modus Memory | FSRS spaced repetition + BM25 | 004 (BM25 search) | Focus FSRS decay, cross-referencing, query expansion |
| 004 | OpenCode Mnemosyne | Hybrid search (FTS5 + vector) | 001 (FTS5), 003 (BM25) | Focus vector search, plugin architecture, scoping |

### 4.3 What This Repo Already Has

`Code_Environment/Public` already has Spec Kit Memory with a hybrid vector/BM25 memory retrieval pipeline in `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/handlers/memory-search.ts`, startup and resume flows in `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/context-server.ts`, and CocoIndex for semantic code search through `.opencode/skill/mcp-coco-index/README.md`. It also already has a compaction-oriented transport plugin in `.opencode/plugins/spec-kit-compact-code-graph.js` that injects structural context during `experimental.session.compacting`.

What this repo does **not** currently have is an OpenCode memory plugin that wraps a standalone local binary, a first-class project/global tool pair with Mnemosyne's lightweight ergonomics, or a memory-specific compaction hook that injects tool-usage guidance directly into the compaction prompt. Do not repeat the outdated claim that Public lacks hybrid BM25+vector memory retrieval; compare Mnemosyne against the current code, not stale assumptions.

## 5. Instructions

1. Treat `/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/004-opencode-mnemosyne-main` as the pre-approved phase folder. Skip Gate 3, keep all writes inside this phase folder, and treat everything under `external/` as read-only.
2. Start with the plugin entry point: read `external/opencode-mnemosyne-main/src/index.ts` from top to bottom before the README. Confirm how the OpenCode plugin is declared, how `ctx.directory` / `ctx.worktree` are resolved, how project names are normalized, and where collection initialization happens.
3. Read `external/opencode-mnemosyne-main/package.json` immediately after `src/index.ts` to confirm packaging boundaries, plugin metadata, runtime assumptions, and whether the repo exposes any source beyond the wrapper.
4. Trace the shared `mnemosyne(...args)` bridge in `src/index.ts`: `Bun.spawn`, `cwd` selection, stdout/stderr handling, exit-code failure behavior, missing-binary fallback, and the security implication of passing argv arrays instead of interpolated shell strings.
5. Examine `memory_recall` and `memory_recall_global` in detail. Trace argument schemas, quoted search-string handling, project vs global flags, `--format plain`, and how the wrapper surfaces "No memories found" versus real backend output.
6. Examine `memory_store` and `memory_store_global` in detail. Trace write semantics, lazy creation of the global collection, project collection auto-init, and what these choices imply for memory scoping, onboarding friction, and failure modes.
7. Examine `memory_delete` in detail. Trace how document IDs are expected to flow from recall results into deletion, and what this says about memory lifecycle and hygiene expectations.
8. Examine the `experimental.session.compacting` hook implementation in `src/index.ts` line by line. Treat this as the most novel feature of the phase: capture exactly what guidance is injected, when it runs, and how that compares with Public's structural compaction plugin in `.opencode/plugins/spec-kit-compact-code-graph.js`.
9. Only after the wrapper analysis, read `external/opencode-mnemosyne-main/README.md`. Use it to extract hybrid-search claims, model choice, AGENTS.md guidance, offline-first positioning, and the stated project/global collection model. Distinguish clearly between wrapper-verified behavior and backend claims that are only documented here.
10. Treat the Mnemosyne backend as an interface contract, not an implementation you can prove from this repo. Infer the wrapper-visible backend verbs (`init`, `search`, `add`, `delete`) and the documented hybrid-search behavior, but do not fabricate internal Go ranking logic that is not present in the checked-out plugin repository.
11. Compare Mnemosyne directly against current `Code_Environment/Public` code: `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/handlers/memory-search.ts` for existing hybrid retrieval, `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/context-server.ts` for session bootstrap/resume behavior, `.opencode/plugins/spec-kit-compact-code-graph.js` for compaction injection, and `.opencode/skill/mcp-coco-index/README.md` for semantic code-search positioning.
12. Resolve cross-phase boundaries explicitly. Do not redo phase `001` as generic FTS5 study or phase `003` as generic BM25 study. This phase owns wrapper-to-backend boundaries, vector-search implications, OpenCode plugin ergonomics, project/global scoping, AGENTS guidance, and memory-awareness compaction behavior.
13. Before deep research begins, ensure the phase folder contains the required Spec Kit docs for the chosen level. Validate the phase folder with:
    ```bash
    cd /Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public && bash .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/spec/validate.sh "/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/004-opencode-mnemosyne-main" --strict
    ```
14. After validation passes, run deep research using this exact topic:
    ```text
    Research the external repository at /Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/004-opencode-mnemosyne-main/external/opencode-mnemosyne-main and identify concrete improvements for Code_Environment/Public, especially around hybrid search (BM25 + vector embeddings), OpenCode plugin architecture, memory scoping (project vs global), session compaction resilience, and offline-first memory design.
    ```
15. Save all outputs inside this phase folder, especially under `research/`. Every meaningful finding must cite exact file paths, say whether the evidence is wrapper-confirmed or README-level, explain why it matters for `Code_Environment/Public`, classify the recommendation as `adopt now`, `prototype later`, or `reject`, and identify the affected subsystem. When research is complete, update `checklist.md`, create `implementation-summary.md`, and save memory with:
    ```bash
    cd /Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public && node .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/dist/memory/generate-context.js "/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/004-opencode-mnemosyne-main"
    ```

## 6. Research Questions

1. How is hybrid retrieval presented at the plugin boundary: what does the README claim about BM25, vector similarity, and Reciprocal Rank Fusion, and what parts of that pipeline are actually visible from the wrapper?
2. Why does Mnemosyne use `snowflake-arctic-embed-m-v1.5`, and what should `Code_Environment/Public` learn from that model choice even if Public already has other embedding-backed retrieval systems?
3. How effective is Mnemosyne's project-vs-global scope split, and would a similar ergonomic separation improve Public's memory-save and recall flows without duplicating existing scoped retrieval features?
4. What exactly does the compaction hook preserve, and how does prompt-level tool guidance differ from Public's current structural-context compaction transport?
5. What operational value comes from the plugin auto-initializing the project collection and lazily initializing the global collection, and what failure or ambiguity risks come with deriving the project key from the directory basename?
6. How should the README's AGENTS.md recommendation be interpreted as workflow guidance: is it merely usage advice, or does it reveal a reusable memory-discipline pattern for Public sessions?
7. Compared with CocoIndex's semantic code search, what is unique about Mnemosyne's hybrid memory retrieval story, and where should those systems stay separate rather than merged?
8. Compared with Public's current `memory_search` pipeline, which Mnemosyne ideas are already covered, which are partial overlaps, and which are genuinely new?
9. How does the OpenCode plugin lifecycle shape adoption compared with MCP-server-based memory systems: installation, runtime assumptions, binary dependency management, and tool exposure ergonomics?
10. What are the practical implications of the offline-first design, including local model download cost, first-run latency, privacy benefits, and failure handling when the binary or model is missing?

## 7. Do's

- Do trace the full wrapper lifecycle in `src/index.ts`, not just the README summary.
- Do separate wrapper-confirmed behavior from backend claims documented only in `README.md`.
- Do trace the hybrid-search narrative end to end as a contract: query entry, quoted search handoff, backend search call, and fused-ranking claims.
- Do study project and global scoping as product decisions, not just CLI flags.
- Do examine the compaction hook as the phase's highest-priority differentiator for `Code_Environment/Public`.
- Do compare against current Public files so the research reflects today's hybrid retrieval and compaction behavior.
- Do note where the external repo has no extra architecture files or AGENTS file, and treat that absence as evidence about how thin the wrapper really is.

## 8. Don'ts

- Do not spend most of the analysis on Mnemosyne's unseen Go internals; they are a dependency, not the plugin repo under study.
- Do not conflate the TypeScript wrapper with the backend search implementation. State clearly when a claim is README-level rather than source-proven.
- Do not ignore the compaction hook; it is the most novel and transferable feature for `Code_Environment/Public`.
- Do not claim Public lacks hybrid BM25+vector memory retrieval when `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/handlers/memory-search.ts` already proves otherwise.
- Do not try to run the system unless the binary and model are already installed; static analysis is sufficient for this phase, and first-run model download is large.
- Do not collapse this phase into generic FTS5 or BM25 discussion already owned by phases `001` and `003`.
- Do not edit anything under `external/` or outside this phase folder.

## 9. Examples

### Example A: Hybrid-search contract finding

```text
**Finding: Hybrid retrieval is a documented backend contract, not a wrapper-owned algorithm**
- Source: external/opencode-mnemosyne-main/README.md; external/opencode-mnemosyne-main/src/index.ts
- What it does: The README states that Mnemosyne combines SQLite FTS5/BM25 and sqlite-vec cosine similarity with Reciprocal Rank Fusion, while the wrapper simply forwards quoted search queries to `mnemosyne search`.
- Why it matters: Public should not copy README marketing language into implementation plans without deciding whether the value lies in ranking math, wrapper ergonomics, or agent-facing tool guidance.
- Recommendation: prototype later
- Affected area: Spec Kit Memory retrieval positioning, future plugin or wrapper design
- Risk/cost: Medium; backend behavior is not directly inspectable from this repo
```

### Example B: Compaction-resilience finding

```text
**Finding: Memory-tool awareness survives compaction through prompt injection**
- Source: external/opencode-mnemosyne-main/src/index.ts; .opencode/plugins/spec-kit-compact-code-graph.js
- What it does: Mnemosyne appends a compact memory-usage instruction block during `experimental.session.compacting`, while Public's existing compaction plugin injects structural transport context rather than memory-tool reminders.
- Why it matters: Public may already preserve structural state across compaction, but it does not yet remind the agent of concrete memory tools in the same direct way.
- Recommendation: adopt now or prototype later, depending on desired runtime surface
- Affected area: compaction strategy, startup guidance, memory-tool ergonomics
- Risk/cost: Low to medium; prompt noise and duplicate instruction handling must be designed carefully
```

## 10. Constraints

### 10.1 Error handling

- If a claim is only present in the README and not in `src/index.ts`, label it as documented behavior, not source-confirmed implementation.
- If current `Code_Environment/Public` behavior contradicts the phase brief, correct the comparison to match the code.
- If the external repo structure differs from the assumed paths, preserve the same analytical order and document the actual files used.
- If a recommendation depends on backend internals that are not visible here, mark that gap explicitly instead of guessing.

### 10.2 Scope

**IN SCOPE**

- OpenCode plugin entry point and lifecycle
- CLI bridge design and error handling
- five memory tools and their ergonomics
- project/global scoping model
- documented hybrid search contract
- AGENTS.md integration guidance from the README
- compaction-hook behavior and comparison with Public
- offline-first operational tradeoffs

**OUT OF SCOPE**

- reverse-engineering the unseen Mnemosyne Go ranking internals
- generic TypeScript style commentary
- plugin publishing workflow details
- broad FTS5 or BM25 primers already covered by other phases
- speculative replacement of Public's existing retrieval stack without evidence

### 10.3 Prioritization framework

Rank findings in this order: compaction-resilience leverage, fit with Public's current hybrid retrieval stack, clarity of wrapper-vs-backend boundary, usefulness of project/global scoping ergonomics, offline-first operational value, implementation cost, and clean differentiation from phases `001` and `003`.

## 11. Deliverables

- `phase-research-prompt.md` present and tailored specifically to `004-opencode-mnemosyne-main`
- `research/research.md` as the canonical report with at least 5 evidence-backed findings
- explicit comparison against current Public files for hybrid retrieval, session recovery, compaction injection, and CocoIndex positioning
- each finding labeled `adopt now`, `prototype later`, or `reject`
- each finding states whether evidence is wrapper-confirmed, README-documented, or both
- `implementation-summary.md` created at the end
- memory saved from this phase folder using `generate-context.js`

Minimum finding schema:

- finding title

- evidence type: wrapper-confirmed / README-documented / both
- what OpenCode Mnemosyne does
- why it matters for `Code_Environment/Public`
- recommendation: `adopt now`, `prototype later`, or `reject`
- affected subsystem
- migration, ambiguity, or validation risk

## 12. Evaluation Criteria

  - **Role** is specialized in hybrid search, plugin architecture, scoping, and compaction resilience
  - **Instructions** are ordered, concrete, path-specific, and start with the plugin entry point
  - **Context** is domain-specific, cross-phase aware, and corrected to match current Public capabilities
  - **Constraints** clearly separate wrapper evidence from README-level claims
  - **Examples** show strong Mnemosyne-derived findings about hybrid search contracts and compaction hooks
- at least 5 findings are evidence-backed rather than generic
- cross-phase overlap with `001` and `003` is resolved explicitly
- findings compare Mnemosyne with current Public hybrid retrieval and compaction behavior rather than a stale baseline
- project/global scoping, AGENTS guidance, offline-first tradeoffs, and compaction survival are all covered directly

- the exact validation command was used for this phase folder
- the exact deep-research topic string appears in the work
- `research/research.md` contains at least 5 evidence-backed findings
- each finding distinguishes wrapper-confirmed behavior from README-documented claims where needed
- `checklist.md` is updated with evidence and completion marks

I’m treating this as a read-only deep-research pass for iteration 7, focused on agent integration patterns in the external Mnemosyne wrapper and how they compare to Public’s current memory surfaces. I’ll start by pulling any relevant prior memory context, then trace the requested source files in the exact order you specified and synthesize only net-new findings.

codex
I’ve got the memory pass and scope inventory; there’s no deeper `AGENTS.md` under the Mnemosyne external folder, so the analysis can stay anchored on the files you pointed at plus the repo-root guidance. Next I’m tracing `src/index.ts` top-to-bottom, validating the phase folder as requested, and then I’ll compare the wrapper’s agent-facing patterns against Public’s current retrieval, compaction, and scoping surfaces.

     1	# AI Assistant Framework (Universal Template)
     2	
     3	> **Universal behavior framework** defining guardrails, standards, and decision protocols.
     4	
     5	---
     6	
     7	## 1. 🚨 CRITICAL RULES
     8	
     9	**HARD BLOCKERS (The "Four Laws" of Agent Safety):**
    10	1. **READ FIRST:** Never edit a file without reading it first. Understand context before modifying.
    11	2. **SCOPE LOCK:** Only modify files explicitly in scope. **NO** "cleaning up" or "improving" adjacent code. Scope in `spec.md` is FROZEN.
    12	3. **VERIFY:** Syntax checks and tests **MUST** pass before claiming completion. **NO** blind commits.
    13	4. **HALT:** Stop immediately if uncertain, if line numbers don't match, or if tests fail. (See "Halt Conditions" below).
    14	
    15	**OPERATIONAL MANDATES:**
    16	- **All file modifications require a spec folder** (Gate 3).
    17	- **Never lie or fabricate** - use "UNKNOWN" when uncertain.
    18	- **Clarify** if confidence < 80% (see §5 Confidence Framework).
    19	- **Use explicit uncertainty:** Prefix claims with "I'M UNCERTAIN ABOUT THIS:".
    20	
    21	**QUALITY PRINCIPLES:**
    22	- **Prefer simplicity**, reuse existing patterns, and cite evidence with sources
    23	- Solve only the stated problem; **avoid over-engineering** and premature optimization
    24	- **Verify with checks** (simplicity, performance, maintainability, scope) before making changes
    25	- **Truth over agreement** - correct user misconceptions with evidence; do not agree for conversational flow
    26	
    27	**HALT CONDITIONS (Stop and Report):**
    28	- [ ] Target file does not exist or line numbers don't match.
    29	- [ ] Syntax check or Tests fail after edit.
    30	- [ ] Merge conflicts encountered.
    31	- [ ] Edit tool reports "string not found".
    32	- [ ] Test/Production boundary is unclear.
    33	
    34	**MANDATORY TOOLS:**
    35	- **Spec Kit Memory MCP** for research tasks, context recovery, and finding prior work.  **Memory saves MUST use `node .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/dist/memory/generate-context.js`** — NEVER manually create memory files.
    36	  - AI composes structured JSON → `generate-context.js --json '{"specFolder":"...","sessionSummary":"..."}' [spec-folder]` or writes to `/tmp/save-context-data.json` and passes as first arg.
    37	- **Code Search Decision Tree** (MANDATORY):
    38	  - Semantic/concept search → `mcp__cocoindex_code__search` (CocoIndex). Skill: `.opencode/skill/mcp-coco-index/`
    39	  - Structural queries (callers, imports, deps) → `code_graph_query` (Code Graph)
    40	  - Exact text/regex → `Grep`
    41	
    42	**GIT WORKFLOW:** 
    43	Full details: `.opencode/skill/sk-git/`
    44	- Worktree setup, conventional commits, PR creation, branch management
    45	- Trigger keywords: worktree, branch, commit, merge, pr, pull request, git workflow, finish work, integrate changes
    46	
    47	### Quick Reference: Common Workflows
    48	
    49	| Task                      | Flow                                                                                                                               |

    55	| **Save context**          | `/memory:save` OR compose JSON → `generate-context.js --json '<data>' [spec-folder]` → Auto-indexed |
    56	| **Claim completion**      | Validation runs automatically → Load `checklist.md` → Verify ALL items → Mark with evidence                                        |

    61	| **Web code**              | sk-code-web skill → Webflow/CDN standards, minification, browser testing                                                           |
    62	| **OpenCode system code**  | sk-code-opencode skill → JS/TS/Python/Shell standards, language detection, quality checklists                                       |

    64	| **Phase workflow**        | `/spec_kit:plan :with-phases` or `/spec_kit:complete :with-phases` → Decompose → `create.sh --phase` → Populate → Plan first child  |

    72	## Context Recovery
    73	
    74	These recovery steps are universal across Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex CLI, Copilot CLI, and Gemini CLI.
    75	
    76	### After Context Compaction Or `/clear`
    77	
    78	1. **FIRST ACTION** — call `memory_context({ input: "resume previous work", mode: "resume", profile: "resume" })`
    79	2. Review the recovered state: current task, spec folder, blockers, and next steps
    80	3. Re-read the active runtime-specific instructions if they exist (`CODEX.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `.claude/CLAUDE.md`, runtime agent docs)
    81	4. Present a concise recovered summary and WAIT for confirmation before proceeding
    82	
    83	### Coding Analysis Lenses 
    84	
    85	| Lens               | Focus            | Detection Questions                                                                |
    86	| ------------------ | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    87	| **CLARITY**        | Simplicity       | Is this the simplest code that solves the problem? Are abstractions earned?        |
    88	| **SYSTEMS**        | Dependencies     | What does this change touch? What calls this? What are the side effects?           |
    89	| **BIAS**           | Wrong problem    | Is user solving a symptom? Is this premature optimization? Is the framing correct? |
    90	| **SUSTAINABILITY** | Maintainability  | Will future devs understand this? Is it self-documenting? Tech debt implications?  |
    91	| **VALUE**          | Actual impact    | Does this change behavior or just refactor? Is it cosmetic or functional?          |
    92	| **SCOPE**          | Complexity match | Does solution complexity match problem size? Single-line fix or new abstraction?   |
    93	
    94	### Coding Anti-Patterns (Detect Silently)
    95	
    96	| Anti-Pattern           | Trigger Phrases                                 | Response                                                                    |
    97	| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    98	| Over-engineering       | "for flexibility", "future-proof", "might need" | Ask: "Is this solving a current problem or a hypothetical one?"             |
    99	| Premature optimization | "could be slow", "might bottleneck"             | Ask: "Has this been measured? What's the actual performance?"               |
   100	| Cargo culting          | "best practice", "always should"                | Ask: "Does this pattern fit this specific case?"                            |
   101	| Gold-plating           | "while we're here", "might as well"             | Flag scope creep: "That's a separate change - shall I note it for later?"   |
   102	| Wrong abstraction      | "DRY this up" for 2 instances                   | "These look similar but might not be the same concept. Let's verify first." |
   103	| Scope creep            | "also add", "bonus feature"                     | "That's outside the current scope. Want to track it separately?"            |

   107	## 2. ⛔ MANDATORY GATES - STOP BEFORE ACTING
   108	
   109	**⚠️ BEFORE using ANY tool (except Gate Actions: memory_match_triggers, skill_advisor.py), you MUST pass all applicable gates below.**
   110	
   111	### 🔒 PRE-EXECUTION GATES (Pass before ANY tool use)
   112	
   113	#### GATE 1: UNDERSTANDING + CONTEXT SURFACING [SOFT] BLOCK
   114	Trigger: EACH new user message (re-evaluate even in ongoing conversations)
   115	1. Call `memory_match_triggers(prompt)` → Surface relevant context
   116	2. Classify intent: Research or Implementation
   117	3. Parse request → Check confidence AND uncertainty (see §4)
   118	4. **Dual-threshold:** confidence ≥ 0.70 AND uncertainty ≤ 0.35 → PROCEED. Either fails → INVESTIGATE (max 3 iterations) → ESCALATE. Simple: <40% ASK | 40-69% CAUTION | ≥70% PASS
   119	
   120	> Gate 1 is SOFT — if file modification detected, Gate 3 (HARD) takes precedence. Ask spec folder question BEFORE analysis.
   121	
   122	####  GATE 2: SKILL ROUTING [REQUIRED for non-trivial tasks]
   123	1. A) Run: `python3 .opencode/skill/scripts/skill_advisor.py "[request]" --threshold 0.8`
   124	2. B) Cite user's explicit direction: "User specified: [exact quote]"
   125	- Confidence ≥ 0.8 → MUST invoke skill | < 0.8 → general approach | User names skill → cite and proceed
   126	- Output: `SKILL ROUTING: [result]` or `SKILL ROUTING: User directed → [name]`
   127	- Skip: trivial queries only (greetings, single-line questions)
   128	
   129	#### GATE 3: SPEC FOLDER QUESTION [HARD] BLOCK — PRIORITY GATE
   130	- **Overrides Gates 1-2:** If file modification detected → ask Gate 3 BEFORE any analysis/tool calls
   131	- **Triggers:** rename, move, delete, create, add, remove, update, change, modify, edit, fix, refactor, implement, build, write, generate, configure, analyze, decompose, phase — or any task resulting in file changes
   132	- **Options:** A) Existing | B) New | C) Update related | D) Skip | E) Phase folder (e.g., `specs/NNN-name/001-phase/`)
   133	- **DO NOT** use Read/Edit/Write/Bash (except Gate Actions) before asking. ASK FIRST, wait for response, THEN proceed
   134	- **Phase boundary:** Gate 3 answers apply ONLY within current workflow phase. Plan→implement transition MUST re-evaluate. Exception: carry-over IS valid for Memory Save Rule
   135	
   136	#### CONSOLIDATED QUESTION PROTOCOL
   137	When multiple inputs are needed, consolidate into a SINGLE prompt — never split across messages. Include only applicable questions; omit when pre-determined.
   138	- **Round-trip optimization** — Only 1 user interaction needed for setup
   139	- **First Message Protocol** — ALL questions asked BEFORE any analysis or tool calls
   140	- **Violation:** Multiple separate prompts → STOP, apologize, re-present as single prompt
   141	- **Bypass phrases:** "skip context" / "fresh start" / "skip memory" / [skip] for memory loading; Level 1 tasks skip completion verification
   142	
   143	---
   144	
   145	### 🔒 POST-EXECUTION RULES
   146	
   147	#### MEMORY SAVE RULE [HARD] BLOCK
   148	Trigger: "save context", "save memory", `/memory:save`, memory file creation
   149	- If spec folder established at Gate 3 → USE IT (don't re-ask). Carry-over applies ONLY to memory saves
   150	- If NO folder and Gate 3 never answered → HARD BLOCK → Ask user
   151	- **Script:** `node .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/dist/memory/generate-context.js`
   152	  - AI composes structured JSON with session context, writes to `/tmp/save-context-data.json`, passes as first arg. Alternatively use `--json '<inline-json>'` or `--stdin`. The AI has strictly better information about its own session than any DB extraction.
   153	  - Subfolder: `003-parent/121-child` or bare `121-child` (auto-searches parents)
   154	- **Indexing:** For immediate MCP visibility after save: `memory_index_scan({ specFolder })` or `memory_save()`
   155	- **Violation:** Write tool on `memory/` path → DELETE and re-run via script
   156	- **Post-Save Review:** After `generate-context.js` completes, check the POST-SAVE QUALITY REVIEW output.
   157	  - **HIGH** issues: MUST manually patch via Edit tool (fix title, trigger_phrases, importance_tier)
   158	  - **MEDIUM** issues: patch when practical
   159	  - **PASSED/SKIPPED**: no action needed
   160	
   161	#### COMPLETION VERIFICATION RULE [HARD] BLOCK
   162	Trigger: Claiming "done", "complete", "finished", "works"
   163	1. Validation runs automatically on spec folder (if exists)
   164	2. Load `checklist.md` → Verify ALL items → Mark `[x]` with evidence
   165	- Skip: Level 1 tasks (no checklist.md required) | Exit 0 = pass, Exit 1 = warnings, Exit 2 = errors (must fix)
   166	
   167	#### VIOLATION RECOVERY [SELF-CORRECTION]
   168	Trigger: About to skip gates, or realized gates were skipped → STOP → STATE: "Before I proceed, I need to ask about documentation:" → ASK Gate 3 (A/B/C/D/E) → WAIT
   169	
   170	#### Self-Check (before ANY tool-using response):
   171	- [ ] File modification? Asked spec folder question?
   172	- [ ] Skill routing verified?
   173	- [ ] Saving memory? Using `generate-context.js` (not Write tool)?
   174	- [ ] Aligned with ORIGINAL request? No scope drift?
   175	- [ ] Claiming completion? `checklist.md` verified?

   179	## 3. 📝 CONVERSATION DOCUMENTATION
   180	
   181	Every conversation that modifies files MUST have a spec folder. **Full details:** system-spec-kit SKILL.md (§1 When to Use, §3 How it Works, §4 Rules)
   182	
   183	### Documentation Levels
   184	
   185	| Level  | LOC            | Required Files                                        | Use When                           |
   186	| ------ | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
   187	| **1**  | <100           | spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md, implementation-summary.md | All features (minimum)             |
   188	| **2**  | 100-499        | Level 1 + checklist.md                                | QA validation needed               |
   189	| **3**  | ≥500           | Level 2 + decision-record.md (+ optional research.md) | Complex/architecture changes       |
   190	| **3+** | Complexity 80+ | Level 3 + AI protocols, extended checklist, sign-offs | Multi-agent, enterprise governance |
   191	
   192	> **Note:** `implementation-summary.md` is REQUIRED for all levels but created **after implementation completes**, not at spec folder creation time. See SKILL.md §4 Rule 13.
   193	
   194	**Rules:** When in doubt → higher level. LOC is soft guidance (risk/complexity can override). Single typo/whitespace fixes (<5 characters in one file) are exempt.
   195	
   196	**Spec folder path:** `specs/[###-short-name]/` | **Templates:** `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/templates/`
   197	
   198	**For details on:** folder structure, `scratch/` vs `memory/` usage, sub-folder versioning, checklist verification (P0/P1/P2), and completion workflow — see system-spec-kit SKILL.md §3.

   202	## 4. 🧑‍🏫 CONFIDENCE & CLARIFICATION FRAMEWORK
   203	
   204	**Core Principle:** If confidence < 80%, pause and ask for clarification with multiple-choice options.
   205	
   206	| Confidence   | Action                                       |
   207	| ------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
   208	| **≥80%**     | Proceed with citable source                  |
   209	| **40-79%**   | Proceed with caveats                         |
   210	| **<40%**     | Ask for clarification or mark "UNKNOWN"      |
   211	| **Override** | Blockers/conflicts → ask regardless of score |
   212	
   213	**Logic-Sync Protocol:** On contradiction (Spec vs Code, conflicting requirements) → HALT → Report "LOGIC-SYNC REQUIRED: [Fact A] contradicts [Fact B]" → Ask "Which truth prevails?"
   214	
   215	**Escalation:** Confidence stays <80% after two failed attempts → ask with 2-3 options. Blockers beyond control → escalate with evidence and proposed next step.

codex
The wrapper code confirms a few useful boundaries already: there’s no passive capture hook beyond compaction guidance, project scoping is just the normalized basename of `directory || worktree || cwd`, and global memory is intentionally lazy-initialized only on first write. I’m now pulling the package/README contract and the Public comparison files so I can isolate what is genuinely new versus already covered by our current stack.

     1	# opencode-mnemosyne
     2	
     3	OpenCode plugin for **local persistent memory** using [Mnemosyne](https://github.com/gandazgul/mnemosyne). Gives your AI coding agent memory that persists across sessions -- entirely offline, no cloud APIs.
     4	
     5	This is the local/offline alternative to cloud-based memory plugins like opencode-supermemory.
     6	
     7	## Prerequisites
     8	
     9	Install the mnemosyne binary first:
    10	
    11	```bash
    12	# From source (requires Go 1.21+, GCC, Task)
    13	git clone https://github.com/gandazgul/mnemosyne.git
    14	cd mnemosyne
    15	task install
    16	```
    17	
    18	See the [mnemosyne README](https://github.com/gandazgul/mnemosyne#quick-start) for detailed setup instructions. On first use, mnemosyne will automatically download its ML models (~500 MB one-time).
    19	
    20	## Install
    21	
    22	Add to your `opencode.json`:
    23	
    24	```json
    25	{
    26	  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
    27	  "plugin": ["opencode-mnemosyne"]
    28	}
    29	```
    30	
    31	That's it. OpenCode will install the plugin automatically.
    32	
    33	## What it does
    34	
    35	### Tools
    36	
    37	The plugin registers five tools available to the AI agent:
    38	
    39	| Tool | Description |
    40	|------|-------------|
    41	| `memory_recall` | Search project memory for relevant context and past decisions |
    42	| `memory_recall_global` | Search global memory for cross-project preferences |
    43	| `memory_store` | Store a project-scoped memory (optionally as `core`) |
    44	| `memory_store_global` | Store a cross-project memory (optionally as `core`) |
    45	| `memory_delete` | Delete an outdated memory by its document ID |
    46	
    47	### Hooks
    48	
    49	- **`experimental.session.compacting`** -- Injects memory tool instructions into the compaction prompt so the agent retains awareness of its memory capabilities across context window resets.
    50	
    51	### Memory scoping
    52	
    53	| Scope | Collection | Persists across |
    54	|-------|-----------|-----------------|
    55	| Project | `<directory-name>` | Sessions in the same project |
    56	| Global | `global` | All projects |
    57	| Core (project) | `<directory-name>` (tagged `core`) | Sessions + survives compaction |
    58	| Core (global) | `global` (tagged `core`) | All projects + survives compaction |
    59	
    60	The project collection is auto-initialized when the plugin loads. The global collection is created on first use of `memory_store_global`.
    61	
    62	## AGENTS.md (recommended)
    63	
    64	For best results, add this to your project or global `AGENTS.md` so the agent uses memory proactively from the start of each session:
    65	
    66	```markdown
    67	## Memory (mnemosyne)
    68	
    69	- At the start of a session, use memory_recall and memory_recall_global to search for context
    70	  relevant to the user's first message.
    71	- After significant decisions, use memory_store to save a concise summary.
    72	- Delete contradicted memories with memory_delete before storing updated ones.
    73	- Use memory_recall_global / memory_store_global for cross-project preferences.
    74	- Mark critical, always-relevant context as core (core=true) — but use sparingly.
    75	- When you are done with a session, store any memories that you think are relevant
    76	  to the user and the project. This will help you recall important information in
    77	  future sessions.
    78	```
    79	
    80	## How it works
    81	
    82	Mnemosyne is a local document store with hybrid search:
    83	- **Full-text search** (SQLite FTS5, BM25 ranking)
    84	- **Vector search** (sqlite-vec, cosine similarity with snowflake-arctic-embed-m-v1.5)
    85	- **Reciprocal Rank Fusion** combines both for best results
    86	
    87	All ML inference runs locally via ONNX Runtime. Your memories never leave your machine.
    88	
    89	## Development
    90	
    91	This project uses standard Node.js tools: `npm` for package management and `tsc` (TypeScript compiler) for building.
    92	
    93	```bash
    94	# Install dependencies
    95	npm install
    96	
    97	# Build the project
    98	npm run build
    99	
   100	# Start the compiler in watch mode for development
   101	npm run dev
   102	
   103	# Run TypeScript checks
   104	npm run typecheck
   105	```

    38	## 1. OVERVIEW
    39	
    40	### What This Skill Does
    41	
    42	CocoIndex Code is a semantic code search tool built on vector embeddings. Where `grep` matches exact characters, CocoIndex Code matches meaning. Ask for "retry logic with exponential backoff" and it returns code that implements that pattern, regardless of how the author named variables or functions. This makes it the right tool when you know what a piece of code does but not where it lives or what it is called.
    43	
    44	The skill ships with two access modes. The CLI (`ccc`) is fastest for one-off queries and all index management operations. The MCP server (`ccc mcp`) exposes a single `search` tool that AI agents call directly via stdio transport, integrating semantic search into any tool-calling workflow without leaving the conversation.
    45	
    46	Indexing is incremental and daemon-backed. The first run scans and embeds all supported files in the project. Subsequent runs update only changed files. A background daemon starts automatically on the first command, persists across calls, and restarts itself when settings or the binary version change.
    47	
    48	### Key Statistics
    49	
    50	| Property | Value |
    51	|---|---|
    52	| Version | 1.0.0 |
    53	| MCP tools exposed | 1 (`search`) |
    54	| Supported languages | 28+ |
    55	| Default embedding model | `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (local, no API key) |
    56	| Primary embedding model | `voyage/voyage-code-3` via LiteLLM (1024-dim, requires `VOYAGE_API_KEY`) |
    57	| Vector storage | SQLite via sqlite-vec |
    58	| Chunk size | 1000 chars, 250 char minimum, 150 char overlap |
    59	| Similarity metric | Cosine similarity (0.0 to 1.0) |
    60	
    61	### How This Compares
    62	
    63	| Tool | Use When | Limitation |
    64	|---|---|---|
    65	| `ccc search` (CocoIndex) | You know what code does but not where it lives | Approximate, needs verification |
    66	| `code_graph_query` | You need exact callers, imports, or structural dependencies | Requires the structural graph to be indexed first |
    67	| `Grep` | You know the exact text, symbol, or regex pattern | Cannot find conceptual matches |
    68	| `Glob` | You know the file name or extension pattern | Cannot search file contents |
    69	| `Read` | You know the exact file path | No search capability |
    70	
    71	### Key Features
    72	
    73	| Feature | Description |
    74	|---|---|
    75	| Semantic search | Query by concept or intent, not exact text |
    76	| CLI and MCP modes | `ccc` for terminal use, `ccc mcp` for AI agent integration |
    77	| Language filters | `--lang` (CLI) or `languages` (MCP) narrows results by language |
    78	| Path filters | `--path` (CLI) or `paths` (MCP) scopes results to a directory |
    79	| Incremental indexing | Only re-embeds changed files on subsequent runs |
    80	| Daemon architecture | Auto-starts, auto-restarts on version or settings change |
    81	| Spec Kit integration | Companion lifecycle tools (`ccc_status`, `ccc_reindex`, `ccc_feedback`) and code-graph/session integration are available through system-spec-kit |
    82	| Two embedding models | Local (no API key) or cloud (higher quality) |
    83	| 28+ languages | Language-aware chunk splitting preserves function and class boundaries |
    84	
    85	In the broader system-spec-kit stack, CocoIndex is the semantic half of a three-system retrieval model: CocoIndex finds conceptually similar code, Code Graph answers structural questions, and session bootstrap surfaces CocoIndex readiness during recovery. The companion lifecycle helpers exposed through system-spec-kit are `ccc_status`, `ccc_reindex`, and `ccc_feedback`.

    92	## 2. QUICK START
    93	
    94	**Step 1: Install and verify**
    95	
    96	Run the idempotent bootstrap helper. It installs the binary, initializes the project if needed, and reports readiness.
    97	
    98	```bash
    99	bash .opencode/skill/mcp-coco-index/scripts/ensure_ready.sh --strict --require-config
   100	```
   101	
   102	**Step 2: Build the index**
   103	
   104	Run from the project root. The first run scans all supported files and generates embeddings. It takes 1-5 minutes depending on codebase size.
   105	
   106	```bash
   107	ccc index
   108	```
   109	
   110	**Step 3: Check index status**
   111	
   112	Confirm files are indexed before searching.
   113	
   114	```bash
   115	ccc status
   116	```
   117	
   118	**Step 4: Search**

   133	## 3. FEATURES
   134	
   135	### 3.1 FEATURE HIGHLIGHTS
   136	
   137	CocoIndex Code resolves queries by embedding the natural-language query text and comparing the resulting vector against pre-computed vectors for every code chunk in the index. This means the search engine reads intent, not characters. A query for "graceful shutdown handler" finds code that tears down servers or releases resources, even if the words "graceful", "shutdown", or "handler" never appear in that code.
   138	
   139	The two embedding models trade off quality against convenience. The local model (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) requires no API key and works offline, making it the right default for most projects. The Voyage Code 3 model produces 1024-dimensional vectors trained specifically on code, and consistently returns higher-quality results for complex queries on large codebases. Switching models requires a full reset and reindex because the vector dimensions are incompatible.
   140	
   141	Language and path filters apply after ranking, which means they narrow an already semantically ranked result set rather than replacing semantic ranking with keyword matching. This design keeps the filters fast and the results meaningful. For multi-query agent sessions, set `refresh_index=false` on follow-up calls after the first query has already triggered a refresh. The daemon has a known concurrency issue where simultaneous `refresh_index=true` requests can cause `ComponentContext` errors.
   142	
   143	The CLI and MCP interfaces are complementary, not redundant. The CLI handles index management operations (`index`, `status`, `reset`, `init`, `daemon`) that have no MCP equivalents. The MCP server exposes only the `search` tool because index management is a human-initiated operation, not an agent-initiated one. When building an AI workflow that needs semantic search, configure the MCP server and let agents call `search` directly.

   172	**CLI vs. MCP parameter differences**
   173	
   174	| Concept | CLI | MCP | Note |
   175	|---|---|---|---|
   176	| Language filter | `--lang` (repeatable flag) | `languages` (list) | CLI: one flag per language. MCP: list of strings |
   177	| Path filter | `--path` (single string) | `paths` (list) | CLI: one path. MCP: multiple paths |
   178	| Result limit | `--limit` (default 10) | `limit` (default 5) | Different defaults |
   179	| Index refresh | `--refresh` (default false) | `refresh_index` (default true) | Different defaults |
   180	| Pagination | `--offset` | `offset` (default 0) | Available on both surfaces |
   181	
   182	**Embedding models**
   183	
   184	| Model | Type | Dimensions | API Key | Best For |
   185	|---|---|---|---|---|
   186	| `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` | Local | 384 | None | Offline use, no API dependency |
   187	| `voyage/voyage-code-3` | Cloud via LiteLLM | 1024 | `VOYAGE_API_KEY` | Higher quality code search |
   188	
   189	**Similarity score interpretation**
   190	
   191	| Score Range | Meaning | Action |
   192	|---|---|---|
   193	| 0.8 - 1.0 | Strong match | Read this first |
   194	| 0.6 - 0.8 | Good match | Worth reviewing |
   195	| 0.4 - 0.6 | Moderate match | Scan for usefulness |
   196	| 0.0 - 0.4 | Weak match | Usually skip |

The comparison surface is sharpening: Mnemosyne exposes a very simple five-tool plugin with compaction-time reminders, while Public exposes richer retrieval/session/governance contracts through MCP envelopes and scoped arguments. I’m pulling the missing pieces now: the exact validation result, Public’s scoping/governance hooks, and the compaction-plan content so I can make stronger agent-integration findings instead of repeating the earlier hygiene ones.

Public’s side is now concrete enough for sharper contrasts: it already has passive auto-surfacing at tool-dispatch and compaction, composite recovery via `session_bootstrap`, and governed scope fields down to `tenantId/userId/agentId/sharedSpaceId`. I’m doing one last pass over the external folder structure and a few targeted Public files so the final findings stay anchored on agent integration rather than drifting back into generic retrieval or lifecycle comparisons.

I have enough to synthesize the research itself; I’m just tightening the provenance now so the final write-up is citation-clean and doesn’t overclaim anything that only exists at README level. After that I’ll give you the iteration report in the exact requested format, including the validation result and the sandbox limits that prevented phase-file updates or memory save.

# Iteration 007: AGENT INTEGRATION

## Focus
AGENT INTEGRATION: Agent-agnostic patterns, passive capture, multi-agent safety, project scoping.

## Findings
### Finding 1: Mnemosyne is an intentionally thin, agent-agnostic OpenCode wrapper
- **Source**: [external/src/index.ts:4](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/004-opencode-mnemosyne-main/external/src/index.ts#L4), [external/src/index.ts:38](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/004-opencode-mnemosyne-main/external/src/index.ts#L38), [external/package.json:2](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/004-opencode-mnemosyne-main/external/package.json#L2), [external/tsconfig.json:2](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/004-opencode-mnemosyne-main/external/tsconfig.json#L2)
- **What it does**: Wrapper-confirmed, the repo is basically one plugin entrypoint plus package metadata: it resolves `directory || worktree || cwd`, shells out through `Bun.spawn(["mnemosyne", ...args])`, and returns five tools plus one compaction hook. There is no runtime-specific orchestration layer, no extra policy engine, and no structured adapter boundary beyond raw CLI calls.
- **Why it matters for us**: This is genuinely portable across agents, but it is portable because it is thin. The upside is low integration cost; the downside is that safety, governance, session choreography, and richer recovery all have to live outside the plugin.
- **Recommendation**: prototype later
- **Impact**: medium

### Finding 2: Mnemosyne has no passive capture path; it is manual-store plus reminder-driven behavior
- **Source**: [external/src/index.ts:138](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/004-opencode-mnemosyne-main/external/src/index.ts#L138), [external/src/index.ts:208](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/004-opencode-mnemosyne-main/external/src/index.ts#L208), [external/README.md:62](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/004-opencode-mnemosyne-main/external/README.md#L62), [memory-surface.ts:489](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/hooks/memory-surface.ts#L489), [memory-surface.ts:594](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/hooks/memory-surface.ts#L594), [memory-surface.ts:640](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/hooks/memory-surface.ts#L640)
- **What it does**: Wrapper-confirmed, storing only happens when the agent explicitly calls `memory_store` or `memory_store_global`; the plugin itself never auto-captures decisions. The only passive behavior is reminder text in the compaction hook, reinforced by README-recommended `AGENTS.md` instructions. Public already goes further with session priming plus auto-surfacing at tool dispatch and compaction.
- **Why it matters for us**: Mnemosyne is not a passive-capture upgrade over Public. Its model is “teach the agent to remember,” not “capture memory safely by default.”
- **Recommendation**: reject
- **Impact**: high

### Finding 3: Multi-agent safety is effectively absent at the plugin boundary
- **Source**: [external/src/index.ts:27](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/004-opencode-mnemosyne-main/external/src/index.ts#L27), [external/src/index.ts:96](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/004-opencode-mnemosyne-main/external/src/index.ts#L96), [external/src/index.ts:193](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/004-opencode-mnemosyne-main/external/src/index.ts#L193), [scope-governance.ts:168](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/lib/governance/scope-governance.ts#L168), [scope-governance.ts:218](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/lib/governance/scope-governance.ts#L218), [memory-triggers.ts:291](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/handlers/memory-triggers.ts#L291)
- **What it does**: Wrapper-confirmed, Mnemosyne exposes only project scope and a shared global scope. There are no `tenantId`, `userId`, `agentId`, `sessionId`, or shared-space controls anywhere in the tool interface. Public, by contrast, normalizes scope IDs, can require governed ingest metadata, and fail-closes trigger matches when scope filtering cannot be applied.
- **Why it matters for us**: Earlier findings already showed basename instability; the deeper issue is broader than naming. In a multi-agent or shared-runtime environment, Mnemosyne’s tool surface has no first-class identity boundary, so contamination and unsafe cross-actor mutation are product-level risks, not just implementation details.
- **Recommendation**: NEW FEATURE
- **Impact**: high

### Finding 4: The project-first / global-lazy split is a useful ergonomic pattern, even though the scope model is too weak
- **Source**: [external/src/index.ts:78](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/004-opencode-mnemosyne-main/external/src/index.ts#L78), [external/src/index.ts:160](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/004-opencode-mnemosyne-main/external/src/index.ts#L160), [external/README.md:51](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/004-opencode-mnemosyne-main/external/README.md#L51), [memory-search.ts:492](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/handlers/memory-search.ts#L492), [memory-search.ts:529](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/handlers/memory-search.ts#L529), [memory-surface.ts:478](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/hooks/memory-surface.ts#L478)
- **What it does**: Wrapper-confirmed, the project collection is auto-initialized on plugin load, while the global collection is initialized only on first global write. That asymmetry makes project memory frictionless and global memory explicit. Public already supports broader local/global retrieval semantics through `retrievalLevel: "local" | "global" | "auto"`, but not via a similarly simple project/global tool pair.
- **Why it matters for us**: The useful idea here is not the underlying scope model; it is the product nudge. Mnemosyne subtly teaches the agent “default to project memory, escalate to global only when clearly cross-project.”
- **Recommendation**: prototype later
- **Impact**: medium

### Finding 5: Mnemosyne’s strongest agent-integration idea is a repeated memory-discipline checklist across AGENTS and compaction
- **Source**: [external/src/index.ts:208](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/004-opencode-mnemosyne-main/external/src/index.ts#L208), [external/README.md:62](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/004-opencode-mnemosyne-main/external/README.md#L62), [context-server.ts:755](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/context-server.ts#L755), [opencode-transport.ts:140](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/lib/context/opencode-transport.ts#L140), [spec-kit-compact-code-graph.js:396](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/plugins/spec-kit-compact-code-graph.js#L396)
- **What it does**: Both wrapper-confirmed and README-documented, the same behavioral rules show up twice: search when history matters, store concise decisions, delete contradictions, reserve `core` for always-needed facts, and use global only for cross-project preferences. Public already injects startup and compaction notes, but those notes are more about recovery and structural context than a short memory-discipline checklist.
- **Why it matters for us**: This is more transferable than the backend search claims. It is cheap, runtime-agnostic, and likely to improve agent behavior without changing retrieval or storage internals.
- **Recommendation**: adopt now
- **Impact**: medium

### Finding 6: Mnemosyne’s hybrid search story stays behind the backend contract, so Public should keep memory retrieval and semantic code search separate
- **Source**: [external/src/index.ts:96](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/004-opencode-mnemosyne-main/external/src/index.ts#L96), [external/README.md:80](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/004-opencode-mnemosyne-main/external/README.md#L80), [memory-search.ts:482](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/handlers/memory-search.ts#L482), [memory-context.ts:1078](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/handlers/memory-context.ts#L1078), [mcp-coco-index/README.md:42](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/mcp-coco-index/README.md#L42), [mcp-coco-index/README.md:61](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/mcp-coco-index/README.md#L61)
- **What it does**: README-documented, Mnemosyne says the backend fuses FTS5/BM25 and vector similarity with RRF, but wrapper-confirmed the plugin surface exposes only a plain query string and plain-text results. Public already has hybrid memory retrieval in `memory_search`, orchestration in `memory_context`, and a distinct semantic code-search surface in CocoIndex.
- **Why it matters for us**: The real import from Mnemosyne is not “add hybrid search” because Public already has that. The lesson is to avoid collapsing memory recall and code search into one tool family just because both use embeddings.
- **Recommendation**: reject
- **Impact**: medium

## Assessment
- New information ratio: 0.84
- Questions addressed: agent-agnostic plugin shape, passive capture vs manual capture, multi-agent safety, project/global scoping ergonomics, AGENTS guidance, compaction survival, hybrid-search boundary, CocoIndex separation, offline/local integration assumptions.
- Questions answered: Mnemosyne’s wrapper is intentionally minimal and portable, but it delegates nearly all safe behavior to agent discipline; it has no passive capture or actor-scoped governance, its best transferable idea is the repeated memory-discipline checklist across AGENTS and compaction, and its project-first/global-lazy ergonomics are useful even though the underlying scope model is too weak for Public.
- The exact validation command returned `RESULT: PASSED` with `Summary: Errors: 0  Warnings: 0`, followed by the sandbox warning `cannot create temp file for here document: Operation not permitted`.

## Reflection
- What worked: reading `external/src/index.ts` first made the integration boundary obvious, then comparing it directly to Public’s `memory_context`, `memory_search`, `memory-surface`, and governance code prevented stale-baseline conclusions.
- What did not work: the external repo is so thin that several deeper questions terminate at wrapper absence rather than richer source proof; this sandbox is read-only, so I could not update `research/research.md`, `checklist.md`, `implementation-summary.md`, or run `generate-context.js` to save memory.

## Recommended Next Focus
Trace the adapter contract for an external-binary memory facade that preserves Public-grade multi-agent safety: required structured response envelope, actor/session scope propagation, project-first/global escalation rules, mutation confirmation semantics, and a shared memory-discipline checklist injected at both startup and compaction.

## Findings
### Finding 1: Mnemosyne is an intentionally thin, agent-agnostic OpenCode wrapper

- **Source**: [external/src/index.ts:96](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/004-opencode-mnemosyne-main/external/src/index.ts#L96), [external/README.md:80](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/004-opencode-mnemosyne-main/external/README.md#L80), [memory-search.ts:482](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/handlers/memory-search.ts#L482), [memory-context.ts:1078](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/handlers/memory-context.ts#L1078), [mcp-coco-index/README.md:42](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/mcp-coco-index/README.md#L42), [mcp-coco-index/README.md:61](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/mcp-coco-index/README.md#L61)
- **What it does**: README-documented, Mnemosyne says the backend fuses FTS5/BM25 and vector similarity with RRF, but wrapper-confirmed the plugin surface exposes only a plain query string and plain-text results. Public already has hybrid memory retrieval in `memory_search`, orchestration in `memory_context`, and a distinct semantic code-search surface in CocoIndex.
- **Why it matters for us**: The real import from Mnemosyne is not “add hybrid search” because Public already has that. The lesson is to avoid collapsing memory recall and code search into one tool family just because both use embeddings.
- **Recommendation**: reject

## Assessment
- New information ratio: 0.84
- Questions addressed: agent-agnostic plugin shape, passive capture vs manual capture, multi-agent safety, project/global scoping ergonomics, AGENTS guidance, compaction survival, hybrid-search boundary, CocoIndex separation, offline/local integration assumptions.
- Questions answered: Mnemosyne’s wrapper is intentionally minimal and portable, but it delegates nearly all safe behavior to agent discipline; it has no passive capture or actor-scoped governance, its best transferable idea is the repeated memory-discipline checklist across AGENTS and compaction, and its project-first/global-lazy ergonomics are useful even though the underlying scope model is too weak for Public.
- The exact validation command returned `RESULT: PASSED` with `Summary: Errors: 0  Warnings: 0`, followed by the sandbox warning `cannot create temp file for here document: Operation not permitted`.

## Reflection
- What worked: reading `external/src/index.ts` first made the integration boundary obvious, then comparing it directly to Public’s `memory_context`, `memory_search`, `memory-surface`, and governance code prevented stale-baseline conclusions.
- What did not work: the external repo is so thin that several deeper questions terminate at wrapper absence rather than richer source proof; this sandbox is read-only, so I could not update `research/research.md`, `checklist.md`, `implementation-summary.md`, or run `generate-context.js` to save memory.

## Recommended Next Focus
Trace the adapter contract for an external-binary memory facade that preserves Public-grade multi-agent safety: required structured response envelope, actor/session scope propagation, project-first/global escalation rules, mutation confirmation semantics, and a shared memory-discipline checklist injected at both startup and compaction.
