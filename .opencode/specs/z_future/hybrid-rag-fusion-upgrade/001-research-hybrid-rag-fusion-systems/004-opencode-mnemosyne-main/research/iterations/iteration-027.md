## Findings
### Finding N: [Title]
- **Source**: file path(s)
- **What it does**: technical description
- **Why it matters**: relevance to our system
- **Recommendation**: adopt now / prototype later / reject / NEW FEATURE
- **Impact**: high / medium / low

- **Why it matters**: this is the concrete multi-agent safety mechanism Mnemosyne’s wrapper lacks. Public preserves history instead of forcing overwrite/delete decisions during contention.
- **Recommendation**: adopt now
- **Affected subsystem**: shared-memory collaboration and conflict hygiene
- **Impact**: high

### Finding 4: Public’s private vs shared scoping is first-class and enforced at both save-time and retrieval-time
- **Source**: [scope-governance.ts:456](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/lib/governance/scope-governance.ts#L456), [scope-governance.ts:482](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/lib/governance/scope-governance.ts#L482), [memory-save.ts:1164](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/handlers/memory-save.ts#L1164), [shared-spaces.ts:555](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/lib/collab/shared-spaces.ts#L555), [create-record.ts:108](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/handlers/save/create-record.ts#L108)
- **Evidence type**: wrapper-confirmed
- **What it does**: saves and reads carry `tenantId`, `userId`, `agentId`, `sessionId`, and `sharedSpaceId`; shared rows use membership as the visibility boundary; shared saves require editor access; same-path dedup and existing-row lookup are scope-aware instead of repo-wide.
- **Why it matters**: this is the right answer to “shared vs private” memory. Public does not just have a global bucket; it has explicit private scope, collaborator scope, and scoped dedup so one actor’s memory does not accidentally collapse another actor’s record.
- **Recommendation**: adopt now
- **Affected subsystem**: governed retrieval, shared-memory writes, duplicate suppression
- **Impact**: high

### Finding 5: Public has explicit DB-level concurrency controls, but shared-memory admin auth still trusts transport-supplied identity
- **Source**: [vector-index-store.ts:802](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/lib/search/vector-index-store.ts#L802), [vector-index-store.ts:803](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/lib/search/vector-index-store.ts#L803), [context-server.ts:1632](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/context-server.ts#L1632), [session-manager.ts:603](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/lib/session/session-manager.ts#L603), [reconsolidation-bridge.ts:237](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/handlers/save/reconsolidation-bridge.ts#L237), [shared-memory.ts:232](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/handlers/shared-memory.ts#L232), [shared-memory.ts:245](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/handlers/shared-memory.ts#L245)
- **Evidence type**: wrapper-confirmed
- **What it does**: Public forces WAL, sets `busy_timeout`, uses `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` for session dedup races, and wraps reconsolidation/save paths in transactions. But shared-memory admin mutations still warn that actor IDs are caller-supplied and not yet cryptographically bound to an authenticated transport principal.
- **Why it matters**: concurrency at the SQLite layer is meaningfully stronger in Public than anything the Mnemosyne plugin proves. The remaining gap is not write atomicity; it is identity trust for collaborative admin operations.
- **Recommendation**: NEW FEATURE
- **Affected subsystem**: shared-memory administration and transport auth binding
- **Impact**: high

## Assessment
- New information ratio: 0.44
- The external repo does not prove multi-agent safety beyond CLI invocation hygiene and simple project/global scoping. The stronger answer is that Spec Kit Memory already contains most of the needed safety model: explicit scope metadata, membership-gated shared spaces, append-version conflict recording, manual-merge escalation, lineage-preserving writes, and transactional protections.
- Validation: `bash .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/spec/validate.sh "/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/004-opencode-mnemosyne-main" --strict` returned `RESULT: PASSED` with `Errors: 0  Warnings: 0`; the read-only sandbox also emitted `cannot create temp file for here document: Operation not permitted`.

## Recommended Next Focus
Trace where shared-space conflict recording is invoked from real shared-memory write/update flows, then decide whether Public needs a thin OpenCode-facing wrapper that exposes explicit `private` vs `shared-space` memory tools on top of existing governed scope and conflict machinery rather than copying Mnemosyne’s basename/global model.
--- Iteration 26 ---
## Findings
- **Why it matters**: This is the right architecture for long-lived memory. Permanence, recall probability, and current-session salience should stay independent so we do not accidentally make durable rules feel “old” or recent noise feel “important.”
- **Recommendation**: adopt now
- **Impact**: high

### Finding 3: Reversible forgetting is stronger than hard deletion for durable memory
- **Source**: [archival-manager.ts:358](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/lib/cognitive/archival-manager.ts#L358), [archival-manager.ts:388](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/lib/cognitive/archival-manager.ts#L388), [archival-manager.ts:403](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/lib/cognitive/archival-manager.ts#L403), [archival-manager.ts:558](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/lib/cognitive/archival-manager.ts#L558), [archival-manager.ts:638](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/lib/cognitive/archival-manager.ts#L638), [reconsolidation-bridge.ts:396](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/handlers/save/reconsolidation-bridge.ts#L396); evidence type: wrapper-confirmed
- **What it does**: Public archives low-value memories instead of immediately deleting them, removes archived rows from BM25/vector retrieval, and supports unarchive. The save-time reconsolidation path also archives older near-duplicates rather than physically deleting them.
- **Why it matters**: For long-lived systems, “forgetting” should usually mean reversible removal from active retrieval, not destruction. That preserves lineage, auditability, and recovery when the system over-prunes.
- **Recommendation**: adopt now
- **Impact**: high

### Finding 4: Hard expiry should stay opt-in and explicitly ephemeral
- **Source**: [save/types.ts:139](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/handlers/save/types.ts#L139), [scope-governance.ts:207](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/lib/governance/scope-governance.ts#L207), [scope-governance.ts:255](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/lib/governance/scope-governance.ts#L255), [scope-governance.ts:260](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/lib/governance/scope-governance.ts#L260), [README.md:710](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/README.md#L710), [memory-governance.vitest.ts:160](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/tests/memory-governance.vitest.ts#L160); evidence type: both
- **What it does**: Public supports explicit `retentionPolicy` and `deleteAfter`, and governed ingest rejects `ephemeral` saves without a future expiry. I found test/audit evidence for a `retention_sweep` action, but I did not locate a concrete runtime sweep implementation in this checkout.
- **Why it matters**: This is the correct shape for hard expiry: explicit, narrow, and policy-driven. The gap is operational visibility, not the policy model itself.
- **Recommendation**: prototype later
- **Impact**: medium

RESEARCH BRIEF:
# $refine TIDD-EC Prompt: 004-opencode-mnemosyne-main

## 2. Role

You are a research specialist in hybrid search architectures (BM25 + vector embeddings), OpenCode plugin design, memory scoping patterns, and session compaction resilience. Work like a systems analyst who can separate TypeScript wrapper behavior from backend README claims, trace plugin lifecycle and hook wiring precisely, and translate OpenCode Mnemosyne's concrete design into practical improvements for `Code_Environment/Public`.

## 3. Task

Research OpenCode Mnemosyne's hybrid search architecture, plugin design patterns, and compaction survival strategies to identify practical, evidence-backed improvements for `Code_Environment/Public`, especially around combining text and vector search, OpenCode plugin integration, project-vs-global memory scoping, and preserving memory awareness across context compaction. Focus on what the external repo actually proves in `src/index.ts` and what the README describes about the Mnemosyne backend. Classify each recommendation as `adopt now`, `prototype later`, or `reject`.

## 4. Context

### 4.1 System Description

OpenCode Mnemosyne is an OpenCode plugin that wraps the Go-based Mnemosyne local memory backend. The external repo is intentionally thin: `src/index.ts` contains the plugin entry point, CLI bridge, tool registration, scope initialization, and the `experimental.session.compacting` hook, while `README.md` describes the backend's hybrid retrieval model and intended agent workflow. The documented retrieval stack combines full-text search (SQLite FTS5 with BM25 ranking) and vector search (sqlite-vec cosine similarity using `snowflake-arctic-embed-m-v1.5`), then fuses both with Reciprocal Rank Fusion. All inference is local, the ML model is downloaded on first use (~500 MB), and no cloud APIs are involved.

The plugin exposes five memory tools: `memory_recall`, `memory_recall_global`, `memory_store`, `memory_store_global`, and `memory_delete`. Project scope is derived from the current directory name and auto-initialized during plugin load; the global collection is initialized lazily on first global write. The wrapper shells out to the `mnemosyne` binary via `Bun.spawn`, quotes search strings to avoid FTS syntax issues, and injects compact memory-usage guidance into the compaction prompt so agents retain memory awareness after context resets.

### 4.2 Cross-Phase Awareness Table

| Phase | System | Core Pattern | Overlap Risk | Differentiation |
|-------|--------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|
| 001 | Engram | MCP memory server (Go, SQLite+FTS5) | 004 (FTS5 search) | Focus tool profiles, session lifecycle, topic keys |
| 002 | Mex | Markdown scaffold + drift detection | 004 (memory) | Focus drift detection, scaffold, no-DB approach |
| 003 | Modus Memory | FSRS spaced repetition + BM25 | 004 (BM25 search) | Focus FSRS decay, cross-referencing, query expansion |
| 004 | OpenCode Mnemosyne | Hybrid search (FTS5 + vector) | 001 (FTS5), 003 (BM25) | Focus vector search, plugin architecture, scoping |

### 4.3 What This Repo Already Has

`Code_Environment/Public` already has Spec Kit Memory with a hybrid vector/BM25 memory retrieval pipeline in `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/handlers/memory-search.ts`, startup and resume flows in `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/context-server.ts`, and CocoIndex for semantic code search through `.opencode/skill/mcp-coco-index/README.md`. It also already has a compaction-oriented transport plugin in `.opencode/plugins/spec-kit-compact-code-graph.js` that injects structural context during `experimental.session.compacting`.

What this repo does **not** currently have is an OpenCode memory plugin that wraps a standalone local binary, a first-class project/global tool pair with Mnemosyne's lightweight ergonomics, or a memory-specific compaction hook that injects tool-usage guidance directly into the compaction prompt. Do not repeat the outdated claim that Public lacks hybrid BM25+vector memory retrieval; compare Mnemosyne against the current code, not stale assumptions.

## 5. Instructions

1. Treat `/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/004-opencode-mnemosyne-main` as the pre-approved phase folder. Skip Gate 3, keep all writes inside this phase folder, and treat everything under `external/` as read-only.
2. Start with the plugin entry point: read `external/opencode-mnemosyne-main/src/index.ts` from top to bottom before the README. Confirm how the OpenCode plugin is declared, how `ctx.directory` / `ctx.worktree` are resolved, how project names are normalized, and where collection initialization happens.
3. Read `external/opencode-mnemosyne-main/package.json` immediately after `src/index.ts` to confirm packaging boundaries, plugin metadata, runtime assumptions, and whether the repo exposes any source beyond the wrapper.
4. Trace the shared `mnemosyne(...args)` bridge in `src/index.ts`: `Bun.spawn`, `cwd` selection, stdout/stderr handling, exit-code failure behavior, missing-binary fallback, and the security implication of passing argv arrays instead of interpolated shell strings.
5. Examine `memory_recall` and `memory_recall_global` in detail. Trace argument schemas, quoted search-string handling, project vs global flags, `--format plain`, and how the wrapper surfaces "No memories found" versus real backend output.
6. Examine `memory_store` and `memory_store_global` in detail. Trace write semantics, lazy creation of the global collection, project collection auto-init, and what these choices imply for memory scoping, onboarding friction, and failure modes.
7. Examine `memory_delete` in detail. Trace how document IDs are expected to flow from recall results into deletion, and what this says about memory lifecycle and hygiene expectations.
8. Examine the `experimental.session.compacting` hook implementation in `src/index.ts` line by line. Treat this as the most novel feature of the phase: capture exactly what guidance is injected, when it runs, and how that compares with Public's structural compaction plugin in `.opencode/plugins/spec-kit-compact-code-graph.js`.
9. Only after the wrapper analysis, read `external/opencode-mnemosyne-main/README.md`. Use it to extract hybrid-search claims, model choice, AGENTS.md guidance, offline-first positioning, and the stated project/global collection model. Distinguish clearly between wrapper-verified behavior and backend claims that are only documented here.
10. Treat the Mnemosyne backend as an interface contract, not an implementation you can prove from this repo. Infer the wrapper-visible backend verbs (`init`, `search`, `add`, `delete`) and the documented hybrid-search behavior, but do not fabricate internal Go ranking logic that is not present in the checked-out plugin repository.
11. Compare Mnemosyne directly against current `Code_Environment/Public` code: `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/handlers/memory-search.ts` for existing hybrid retrieval, `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/context-server.ts` for session bootstrap/resume behavior, `.opencode/plugins/spec-kit-compact-code-graph.js` for compaction injection, and `.opencode/skill/mcp-coco-index/README.md` for semantic code-search positioning.
12. Resolve cross-phase boundaries explicitly. Do not redo phase `001` as generic FTS5 study or phase `003` as generic BM25 study. This phase owns wrapper-to-backend boundaries, vector-search implications, OpenCode plugin ergonomics, project/global scoping, AGENTS guidance, and memory-awareness compaction behavior.
13. Before deep research begins, ensure the phase folder contains the required Spec Kit docs for the chosen level. Validate the phase folder with:
    ```bash
    cd /Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public && bash .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/spec/validate.sh "/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/004-opencode-mnemosyne-main" --strict
    ```
14. After validation passes, run deep research using this exact topic:
    ```text
    Research the external repository at /Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/004-opencode-mnemosyne-main/external/opencode-mnemosyne-main and identify concrete improvements for Code_Environment/Public, especially around hybrid search (BM25 + vector embeddings), OpenCode plugin architecture, memory scoping (project vs global), session compaction resilience, and offline-first memory design.
    ```
15. Save all outputs inside this phase folder, especially under `research/`. Every meaningful finding must cite exact file paths, say whether the evidence is wrapper-confirmed or README-level, explain why it matters for `Code_Environment/Public`, classify the recommendation as `adopt now`, `prototype later`, or `reject`, and identify the affected subsystem. When research is complete, update `checklist.md`, create `implementation-summary.md`, and save memory with:
    ```bash
    cd /Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public && node .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/dist/memory/generate-context.js "/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/004-opencode-mnemosyne-main"
    ```

## 6. Research Questions

1. How is hybrid retrieval presented at the plugin boundary: what does the README claim about BM25, vector similarity, and Reciprocal Rank Fusion, and what parts of that pipeline are actually visible from the wrapper?
2. Why does Mnemosyne use `snowflake-arctic-embed-m-v1.5`, and what should `Code_Environment/Public` learn from that model choice even if Public already has other embedding-backed retrieval systems?
3. How effective is Mnemosyne's project-vs-global scope split, and would a similar ergonomic separation improve Public's memory-save and recall flows without duplicating existing scoped retrieval features?
4. What exactly does the compaction hook preserve, and how does prompt-level tool guidance differ from Public's current structural-context compaction transport?
5. What operational value comes from the plugin auto-initializing the project collection and lazily initializing the global collection, and what failure or ambiguity risks come with deriving the project key from the directory basename?
6. How should the README's AGENTS.md recommendation be interpreted as workflow guidance: is it merely usage advice, or does it reveal a reusable memory-discipline pattern for Public sessions?
7. Compared with CocoIndex's semantic code search, what is unique about Mnemosyne's hybrid memory retrieval story, and where should those systems stay separate rather than merged?
8. Compared with Public's current `memory_search` pipeline, which Mnemosyne ideas are already covered, which are partial overlaps, and which are genuinely new?
9. How does the OpenCode plugin lifecycle shape adoption compared with MCP-server-based memory systems: installation, runtime assumptions, binary dependency management, and tool exposure ergonomics?
10. What are the practical implications of the offline-first design, including local model download cost, first-run latency, privacy benefits, and failure handling when the binary or model is missing?

## 7. Do's

- Do trace the full wrapper lifecycle in `src/index.ts`, not just the README summary.
- Do separate wrapper-confirmed behavior from backend claims documented only in `README.md`.
- Do trace the hybrid-search narrative end to end as a contract: query entry, quoted search handoff, backend search call, and fused-ranking claims.
- Do study project and global scoping as product decisions, not just CLI flags.
- Do examine the compaction hook as the phase's highest-priority differentiator for `Code_Environment/Public`.
- Do compare against current Public files so the research reflects today's hybrid retrieval and compaction behavior.
- Do note where the external repo has no extra architecture files or AGENTS file, and treat that absence as evidence about how thin the wrapper really is.

## 8. Don'ts

- Do not spend most of the analysis on Mnemosyne's unseen Go internals; they are a dependency, not the plugin repo under study.
- Do not conflate the TypeScript wrapper with the backend search implementation. State clearly when a claim is README-level rather than source-proven.
- Do not ignore the compaction hook; it is the most novel and transferable feature for `Code_Environment/Public`.
- Do not claim Public lacks hybrid BM25+vector memory retrieval when `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/handlers/memory-search.ts` already proves otherwise.
- Do not try to run the system unless the binary and model are already installed; static analysis is sufficient for this phase, and first-run model download is large.
- Do not collapse this phase into generic FTS5 or BM25 discussion already owned by phases `001` and `003`.
- Do not edit anything under `external/` or outside this phase folder.

## 9. Examples

### Example A: Hybrid-search contract finding

```text
**Finding: Hybrid retrieval is a documented backend contract, not a wrapper-owned algorithm**
- Source: external/opencode-mnemosyne-main/README.md; external/opencode-mnemosyne-main/src/index.ts
- What it does: The README states that Mnemosyne combines SQLite FTS5/BM25 and sqlite-vec cosine similarity with Reciprocal Rank Fusion, while the wrapper simply forwards quoted search queries to `mnemosyne search`.
- Why it matters: Public should not copy README marketing language into implementation plans without deciding whether the value lies in ranking math, wrapper ergonomics, or agent-facing tool guidance.
- Recommendation: prototype later
- Affected area: Spec Kit Memory retrieval positioning, future plugin or wrapper design
- Risk/cost: Medium; backend behavior is not directly inspectable from this repo
```

### Example B: Compaction-resilience finding

```text
**Finding: Memory-tool awareness survives compaction through prompt injection**
- Source: external/opencode-mnemosyne-main/src/index.ts; .opencode/plugins/spec-kit-compact-code-graph.js
- What it does: Mnemosyne appends a compact memory-usage instruction block during `experimental.session.compacting`, while Public's existing compaction plugin injects structural transport context rather than memory-tool reminders.
- Why it matters: Public may already preserve structural state across compaction, but it does not yet remind the agent of concrete memory tools in the same direct way.
- Recommendation: adopt now or prototype later, depending on desired runtime surface
- Affected area: compaction strategy, startup guidance, memory-tool ergonomics
- Risk/cost: Low to medium; prompt noise and duplicate instruction handling must be designed carefully
```

## 10. Constraints

### 10.1 Error handling

- If a claim is only present in the README and not in `src/index.ts`, label it as documented behavior, not source-confirmed implementation.
- If current `Code_Environment/Public` behavior contradicts the phase brief, correct the comparison to match the code.
- If the external repo structure differs from the assumed paths, preserve the same analytical order and document the actual files used.
- If a recommendation depends on backend internals that are not visible here, mark that gap explicitly instead of guessing.

### 10.2 Scope

**IN SCOPE**

- OpenCode plugin entry point and lifecycle
- CLI bridge design and error handling
- five memory tools and their ergonomics
- project/global scoping model
- documented hybrid search contract
- AGENTS.md integration guidance from the README
- compaction-hook behavior and comparison with Public
- offline-first operational tradeoffs

**OUT OF SCOPE**

- reverse-engineering the unseen Mnemosyne Go ranking internals
- generic TypeScript style commentary
- plugin publishing workflow details
- broad FTS5 or BM25 primers already covered by other phases
- speculative replacement of Public's existing retrieval stack without evidence

### 10.3 Prioritization framework

Rank findings in this order: compaction-resilience leverage, fit with Public's current hybrid retrieval stack, clarity of wrapper-vs-backend boundary, usefulness of project/global scoping ergonomics, offline-first operational value, implementation cost, and clean differentiation from phases `001` and `003`.

## 11. Deliverables

- `phase-research-prompt.md` present and tailored specifically to `004-opencode-mnemosyne-main`
- `research/research.md` as the canonical report with at least 5 evidence-backed findings
- explicit comparison against current Public files for hybrid retrieval, session recovery, compaction injection, and CocoIndex positioning
- each finding labeled `adopt now`, `prototype later`, or `reject`
- each finding states whether evidence is wrapper-confirmed, README-documented, or both
- `implementation-summary.md` created at the end
- memory saved from this phase folder using `generate-context.js`

Minimum finding schema:

- finding title
- exact source evidence
- evidence type: wrapper-confirmed / README-documented / both
- what OpenCode Mnemosyne does
- why it matters for `Code_Environment/Public`
- recommendation: `adopt now`, `prototype later`, or `reject`
- affected subsystem
- migration, ambiguity, or validation risk

## 12. Evaluation Criteria

- CLEAR target: `>= 40/50`
- RICCE compliance is visible in the prompt:
  - **Role** is specialized in hybrid search, plugin architecture, scoping, and compaction resilience
  - **Instructions** are ordered, concrete, path-specific, and start with the plugin entry point
  - **Context** is domain-specific, cross-phase aware, and corrected to match current Public capabilities
  - **Constraints** clearly separate wrapper evidence from README-level claims
  - **Examples** show strong Mnemosyne-derived findings about hybrid search contracts and compaction hooks
- at least 5 findings are evidence-backed rather than generic
- cross-phase overlap with `001` and `003` is resolved explicitly
- findings compare Mnemosyne with current Public hybrid retrieval and compaction behavior rather than a stale baseline
- project/global scoping, AGENTS guidance, offline-first tradeoffs, and compaction survival are all covered directly

## 13. Completion Bar

The phase is only complete when all of the following are true:

- the reading order started with `src/index.ts`, then `package.json`, then the five tools, then the compaction hook, then `README.md`
- the exact validation command was used for this phase folder

I’m treating this as a read-only iteration report against the pre-approved phase folder. I’ll follow the requested source order first, then compare it directly against our current memory, resume, compaction, and CocoIndex surfaces before I synthesize DX-specific findings.

# Autonomous Deep Research Loop

Iterative research protocol with fresh context per iteration, externalized state, and convergence detection for deep technical investigation.

Runtime path resolution:
- OpenCode/Copilot runtime: `.opencode/agent/*.md`
- Claude runtime: `.claude/agents/*.md`
- Codex runtime: `.codex/agents/*.toml`

<!-- ANCHOR:when-to-use -->
## 1. WHEN TO USE

### When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Deep investigation requiring multiple rounds of discovery
- Topic spans 3+ technical domains or sources
- Initial findings need progressive refinement
- Overnight or unattended research sessions
- Research where prior findings inform subsequent queries

### When NOT to Use

- Simple, single-question research (use direct codebase search or `/spec_kit:plan`)
- Known-solution documentation (use `/spec_kit:plan`)
- Implementation tasks (use `/spec_kit:implement`)
- Quick codebase searches (use `@context` or direct Grep/Glob)
- Fewer than 3 sources needed (single-pass research suffices)

### Keyword Triggers

`autoresearch`, `deep research`, `autonomous research`, `research loop`, `iterative research`, `multi-round research`, `deep investigation`, `comprehensive research`

For iterative code review and quality auditing, see `sk-deep-review`.

### Lifecycle Contract

Live lifecycle branches:
- `resume` — continue the active lineage
- `restart` — start a new generation with explicit parent linkage
- `fork` — branch from the current packet state
- `completed-continue` — reopen a completed lineage only after immutable synthesis snapshotting

## 2. SMART ROUTING

### Resource Loading Levels

| Level | When to Load | Resources |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| ALWAYS | Every skill invocation | Quick reference baseline |
| CONDITIONAL | If intent signals match | Loop protocol, convergence, state format |
| ON_DEMAND | Only on explicit request | Templates, detailed specifications |

}
```

### Scoped Guard

```python
def _guard_in_skill():
    """Verify this skill is active before loading resources."""
    if not hasattr(_guard_in_skill, '_active'):
        _guard_in_skill._active = True
    return _guard_in_skill._active

def discover_markdown_resources(base_path: Path) -> list[str]:
    """Discover all .md files in the assets directory."""
    return sorted(str(p.relative_to(base_path)) for p in (base_path / "references").glob("*.md"))
```

### Phase Detection

Detect the current research phase from dispatch context to load appropriate resources:

| Phase | Signal | Resources to Load |
|-------|--------|-------------------|
| Init | No JSONL exists | Loop protocol, state format |
| Iteration | Dispatch context includes iteration number | Loop protocol, convergence |
| Stuck | Dispatch context includes "RECOVERY" | Convergence, loop protocol |
| Synthesis | Convergence triggered STOP | Quick reference |

### Core Innovation: Fresh Context Per Iteration

Each agent dispatch gets a fresh context window. State continuity comes from files, not memory. This solves context degradation in long research sessions.

Adapted from: karpathy/autoresearch (loop concept), AGR (fresh context "Ralph Loop"), pi-autoresearch (JSONL state), autoresearch-opencode (context injection).

### Data Flow

```
Init --> Create config.json, strategy.md, state.jsonl
  |
Loop --> Read state --> Check convergence --> Dispatch @deep-research
  |                                              |
  |                                              v
  |                                         Agent executes:
  |                                         1. Read state files
  |                                         2. Determine focus
  |                                         3. Research (3-5 actions)
  |                                         4. Write iteration-NNN.md
  |                                         5. Update strategy.md
  |                                         6. Append state.jsonl
  |                                              |
  +<--- Evaluate results <-----------------------+
  |
  +--- Continue? --> Yes: next iteration
  |                  No: exit loop
  v
Synthesize --> Compile final research/research.md
  |
Save --> generate-context.js --> verify memory artifact
```

### Key Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Externalized state** | All research continuity via files, not agent memory |
| **Fresh context** | Each iteration gets a clean agent with no prior context |
| **Convergence** | Multi-signal detection: newInfoRatio, stuck count, questions answered |
| **Strategy file** | Reducer-synchronized research steering with machine-owned sections |
| **JSONL log** | Append-only structured log for lineage and iteration data |
| **Findings registry** | Reducer-owned open/resolved questions, key findings, and ruled-out directions |

The phase path in the brief is slightly stale, so I’m resolving the actual `external/` layout before I continue the file-by-file trace. After that I’ll inspect the wrapper and our comparison surfaces in the exact order the brief wants.

- Store concise summaries of important decisions, preferences, and patterns.
- Delete outdated memories when new decisions contradict them.
- Use **core** for facts that should always be in context (project architecture, key conventions, user preferences).

# opencode-mnemosyne

OpenCode plugin for **local persistent memory** using [Mnemosyne](https://github.com/gandazgul/mnemosyne). Gives your AI coding agent memory that persists across sessions -- entirely offline, no cloud APIs.

This is the local/offline alternative to cloud-based memory plugins like opencode-supermemory.

## Prerequisites

Install the mnemosyne binary first:

```bash
# From source (requires Go 1.21+, GCC, Task)
git clone https://github.com/gandazgul/mnemosyne.git
cd mnemosyne
task install
```

See the [mnemosyne README](https://github.com/gandazgul/mnemosyne#quick-start) for detailed setup instructions. On first use, mnemosyne will automatically download its ML models (~500 MB one-time).

## Install

Add to your `opencode.json`:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "plugin": ["opencode-mnemosyne"]
}
```

That's it. OpenCode will install the plugin automatically.

## What it does

### Tools

The plugin registers five tools available to the AI agent:

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `memory_recall` | Search project memory for relevant context and past decisions |
| `memory_recall_global` | Search global memory for cross-project preferences |
| `memory_store` | Store a project-scoped memory (optionally as `core`) |
| `memory_store_global` | Store a cross-project memory (optionally as `core`) |
| `memory_delete` | Delete an outdated memory by its document ID |

### Hooks

- **`experimental.session.compacting`** -- Injects memory tool instructions into the compaction prompt so the agent retains awareness of its memory capabilities across context window resets.

### Memory scoping

| Scope | Collection | Persists across |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|
| Project | `<directory-name>` | Sessions in the same project |
| Global | `global` | All projects |
| Core (project) | `<directory-name>` (tagged `core`) | Sessions + survives compaction |
| Core (global) | `global` (tagged `core`) | All projects + survives compaction |

The project collection is auto-initialized when the plugin loads. The global collection is created on first use of `memory_store_global`.

## AGENTS.md (recommended)

For best results, add this to your project or global `AGENTS.md` so the agent uses memory proactively from the start of each session:

```markdown
## Memory (mnemosyne)

- At the start of a session, use memory_recall and memory_recall_global to search for context
  relevant to the user's first message.
- After significant decisions, use memory_store to save a concise summary.
- Delete contradicted memories with memory_delete before storing updated ones.
- Use memory_recall_global / memory_store_global for cross-project preferences.
- Mark critical, always-relevant context as core (core=true) — but use sparingly.
- When you are done with a session, store any memories that you think are relevant
  to the user and the project. This will help you recall important information in
  future sessions.
```

## How it works

Mnemosyne is a local document store with hybrid search:
- **Full-text search** (SQLite FTS5, BM25 ranking)
- **Vector search** (sqlite-vec, cosine similarity with snowflake-arctic-embed-m-v1.5)
- **Reciprocal Rank Fusion** combines both for best results

All ML inference runs locally via ONNX Runtime. Your memories never leave your machine.

## Development

This project uses standard Node.js tools: `npm` for package management and `tsc` (TypeScript compiler) for building.

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the project
npm run build

# Start the compiler in watch mode for development
npm run dev

# Run TypeScript checks
npm run typecheck
```

     1	# opencode-mnemosyne
     2	
     3	OpenCode plugin for **local persistent memory** using [Mnemosyne](https://github.com/gandazgul/mnemosyne). Gives your AI coding agent memory that persists across sessions -- entirely offline, no cloud APIs.
     4	
     5	This is the local/offline alternative to cloud-based memory plugins like opencode-supermemory.
     6	
     7	## Prerequisites
     8	
     9	Install the mnemosyne binary first:
    10	
    11	```bash
    12	# From source (requires Go 1.21+, GCC, Task)
    13	git clone https://github.com/gandazgul/mnemosyne.git
    14	cd mnemosyne
    15	task install
    16	```
    17	
    18	See the [mnemosyne README](https://github.com/gandazgul/mnemosyne#quick-start) for detailed setup instructions. On first use, mnemosyne will automatically download its ML models (~500 MB one-time).
    19	
    20	## Install
    21	
    22	Add to your `opencode.json`:
    23	
    24	```json
    25	{
    26	  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
    27	  "plugin": ["opencode-mnemosyne"]
    28	}
    29	```
    30	
    31	That's it. OpenCode will install the plugin automatically.
    32	
    33	## What it does
    34	
    35	### Tools
    36	
    37	The plugin registers five tools available to the AI agent:
    38	
    39	| Tool | Description |
    40	|------|-------------|
    41	| `memory_recall` | Search project memory for relevant context and past decisions |
    42	| `memory_recall_global` | Search global memory for cross-project preferences |
    43	| `memory_store` | Store a project-scoped memory (optionally as `core`) |
    44	| `memory_store_global` | Store a cross-project memory (optionally as `core`) |
    45	| `memory_delete` | Delete an outdated memory by its document ID |
    46	
    47	### Hooks
    48	
    49	- **`experimental.session.compacting`** -- Injects memory tool instructions into the compaction prompt so the agent retains awareness of its memory capabilities across context window resets.
    50	
    51	### Memory scoping
    52	
    53	| Scope | Collection | Persists across |
    54	|-------|-----------|-----------------|
    55	| Project | `<directory-name>` | Sessions in the same project |
    56	| Global | `global` | All projects |
    57	| Core (project) | `<directory-name>` (tagged `core`) | Sessions + survives compaction |
    58	| Core (global) | `global` (tagged `core`) | All projects + survives compaction |
    59	
    60	The project collection is auto-initialized when the plugin loads. The global collection is created on first use of `memory_store_global`.
    61	
    62	## AGENTS.md (recommended)
    63	
    64	For best results, add this to your project or global `AGENTS.md` so the agent uses memory proactively from the start of each session:
    65	
    66	```markdown
    67	## Memory (mnemosyne)
    68	
    69	- At the start of a session, use memory_recall and memory_recall_global to search for context
    70	  relevant to the user's first message.
    71	- After significant decisions, use memory_store to save a concise summary.
    72	- Delete contradicted memories with memory_delete before storing updated ones.
    73	- Use memory_recall_global / memory_store_global for cross-project preferences.
    74	- Mark critical, always-relevant context as core (core=true) — but use sparingly.
    75	- When you are done with a session, store any memories that you think are relevant
    76	  to the user and the project. This will help you recall important information in
    77	  future sessions.
    78	```
    79	
    80	## How it works
    81	
    82	Mnemosyne is a local document store with hybrid search:
    83	- **Full-text search** (SQLite FTS5, BM25 ranking)
    84	- **Vector search** (sqlite-vec, cosine similarity with snowflake-arctic-embed-m-v1.5)
    85	- **Reciprocal Rank Fusion** combines both for best results
    86	
    87	All ML inference runs locally via ONNX Runtime. Your memories never leave your machine.
    88	
    89	## Development
    90	
    91	This project uses standard Node.js tools: `npm` for package management and `tsc` (TypeScript compiler) for building.
    92	
    93	```bash
    94	# Install dependencies
    95	npm install
    96	
    97	# Build the project
    98	npm run build
    99	
   100	# Start the compiler in watch mode for development
   101	npm run dev
   102	
   103	# Run TypeScript checks
   104	npm run typecheck
   105	```

    38	## 1. OVERVIEW
    39	
    40	### What This Skill Does
    41	
    42	CocoIndex Code is a semantic code search tool built on vector embeddings. Where `grep` matches exact characters, CocoIndex Code matches meaning. Ask for "retry logic with exponential backoff" and it returns code that implements that pattern, regardless of how the author named variables or functions. This makes it the right tool when you know what a piece of code does but not where it lives or what it is called.
    43	
    44	The skill ships with two access modes. The CLI (`ccc`) is fastest for one-off queries and all index management operations. The MCP server (`ccc mcp`) exposes a single `search` tool that AI agents call directly via stdio transport, integrating semantic search into any tool-calling workflow without leaving the conversation.
    45	
    46	Indexing is incremental and daemon-backed. The first run scans and embeds all supported files in the project. Subsequent runs update only changed files. A background daemon starts automatically on the first command, persists across calls, and restarts itself when settings or the binary version change.
    47	
    48	### Key Statistics
    49	
    50	| Property | Value |
    51	|---|---|
    52	| Version | 1.0.0 |
    53	| MCP tools exposed | 1 (`search`) |
    54	| Supported languages | 28+ |
    55	| Default embedding model | `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (local, no API key) |
    56	| Primary embedding model | `voyage/voyage-code-3` via LiteLLM (1024-dim, requires `VOYAGE_API_KEY`) |
    57	| Vector storage | SQLite via sqlite-vec |
    58	| Chunk size | 1000 chars, 250 char minimum, 150 char overlap |
    59	| Similarity metric | Cosine similarity (0.0 to 1.0) |
    60	
    61	### How This Compares
    62	
    63	| Tool | Use When | Limitation |
    64	|---|---|---|
    65	| `ccc search` (CocoIndex) | You know what code does but not where it lives | Approximate, needs verification |
    66	| `code_graph_query` | You need exact callers, imports, or structural dependencies | Requires the structural graph to be indexed first |
    67	| `Grep` | You know the exact text, symbol, or regex pattern | Cannot find conceptual matches |
    68	| `Glob` | You know the file name or extension pattern | Cannot search file contents |
    69	| `Read` | You know the exact file path | No search capability |
    70	
    71	### Key Features
    72	
    73	| Feature | Description |
    74	|---|---|
    75	| Semantic search | Query by concept or intent, not exact text |
    76	| CLI and MCP modes | `ccc` for terminal use, `ccc mcp` for AI agent integration |
    77	| Language filters | `--lang` (CLI) or `languages` (MCP) narrows results by language |
    78	| Path filters | `--path` (CLI) or `paths` (MCP) scopes results to a directory |
    79	| Incremental indexing | Only re-embeds changed files on subsequent runs |
    80	| Daemon architecture | Auto-starts, auto-restarts on version or settings change |
    81	| Spec Kit integration | Companion lifecycle tools (`ccc_status`, `ccc_reindex`, `ccc_feedback`) and code-graph/session integration are available through system-spec-kit |
    82	| Two embedding models | Local (no API key) or cloud (higher quality) |
    83	| 28+ languages | Language-aware chunk splitting preserves function and class boundaries |
    84	
    85	In the broader system-spec-kit stack, CocoIndex is the semantic half of a three-system retrieval model: CocoIndex finds conceptually similar code, Code Graph answers structural questions, and session bootstrap surfaces CocoIndex readiness during recovery. The companion lifecycle helpers exposed through system-spec-kit are `ccc_status`, `ccc_reindex`, and `ccc_feedback`.

    92	## 2. QUICK START
    93	
    94	**Step 1: Install and verify**
    95	
    96	Run the idempotent bootstrap helper. It installs the binary, initializes the project if needed, and reports readiness.
    97	
    98	```bash
    99	bash .opencode/skill/mcp-coco-index/scripts/ensure_ready.sh --strict --require-config
   100	```
   101	
   102	**Step 2: Build the index**
   103	
   104	Run from the project root. The first run scans all supported files and generates embeddings. It takes 1-5 minutes depending on codebase size.
   105	
   106	```bash
   107	ccc index
   108	```
   109	
   110	**Step 3: Check index status**
   111	
   112	Confirm files are indexed before searching.
   113	
   114	```bash
   115	ccc status
   116	```
   117	
   118	**Step 4: Search**
   119	
   120	Run a natural-language query. Add language and path filters to narrow results.
   121	
   122	```bash
   123	ccc search "authentication middleware"
   124	ccc search "error handling" --lang typescript
   125	ccc search "database migration" --path "src/**" --limit 5
   126	```

   133	## 3. FEATURES
   134	
   135	### 3.1 FEATURE HIGHLIGHTS
   136	
   137	CocoIndex Code resolves queries by embedding the natural-language query text and comparing the resulting vector against pre-computed vectors for every code chunk in the index. This means the search engine reads intent, not characters. A query for "graceful shutdown handler" finds code that tears down servers or releases resources, even if the words "graceful", "shutdown", or "handler" never appear in that code.
   138	
   139	The two embedding models trade off quality against convenience. The local model (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) requires no API key and works offline, making it the right default for most projects. The Voyage Code 3 model produces 1024-dimensional vectors trained specifically on code, and consistently returns higher-quality results for complex queries on large codebases. Switching models requires a full reset and reindex because the vector dimensions are incompatible.
   140	
   141	Language and path filters apply after ranking, which means they narrow an already semantically ranked result set rather than replacing semantic ranking with keyword matching. This design keeps the filters fast and the results meaningful. For multi-query agent sessions, set `refresh_index=false` on follow-up calls after the first query has already triggered a refresh. The daemon has a known concurrency issue where simultaneous `refresh_index=true` requests can cause `ComponentContext` errors.
   142	
   143	The CLI and MCP interfaces are complementary, not redundant. The CLI handles index management operations (`index`, `status`, `reset`, `init`, `daemon`) that have no MCP equivalents. The MCP server exposes only the `search` tool because index management is a human-initiated operation, not an agent-initiated one. When building an AI workflow that needs semantic search, configure the MCP server and let agents call `search` directly.
   144

   772	
   773	## User preferences
   774	
   775	- when the user said “Re-use /.../024-compact-code-graph/006-documentation-alignment,” continue under the specified existing spec folder instead of opening a new packet [Task 4]
   776	- when the user asked for deep review “make sure everything works as expected ... check the feature catalog and manual testing playbook, and all commands, agents and readmes,” treat it as full-spectrum audit + runtime/doc parity, not a narrow fix pass [Task 1][Task 2]
   777	- when user asked to “use max sub agents” for packet changelog synthesis, parallelize phase evidence gathering but keep output scoped to the requested packet `scratch/` folder [Task 6]
   778	- when user asked for README work, they specified “proper dedicated section ... reference 024-compact-code-graph ... re-use 006-documentation-alignment” -> preserve that wording/terminology and include those exact packet references [Task 7]
   779	- when refining README wording, the user asked for “current reality” language, plain English, and no “no longer” phrasing or internal spec-folder references in runtime-state descriptions [Task 8]
   780	- when updating changelog claims, keep wording pinned to implemented behavior evidence (bounded inline `selective_reindex` vs explicit operator `code_graph_scan`) [Task 8]
   781	
   782	## Reusable knowledge
   783	
   784	- canonical validation gates for packet readiness here were `bash .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/spec/validate.sh <packet> --recursive --strict` plus `TMPDIR=... npm run check:full` and `npm run build` evidence capture [Task 1][Task 2]
   785	- for strict validator compliance, checklist lines need explicit `[EVIDENCE: ...]` and level-template headers/section numbers must remain exact (`## 1. METADATA`, `## 2. PROBLEM & PURPOSE`, etc.) [Task 3]
   786	- `session_bootstrap()` is the primary recovery call for non-hook flows; docs should mention fallback `memory_context({mode:"resume",profile:"resume"})` only after bootstrap guidance [Task 4]
   787	- hook path truth is `mcp_server/hooks/claude/*.ts` and compiled `mcp_server/dist/hooks/claude/*.js`; avoid stale `scripts/hooks/claude/` references [Task 4]
   788	- changelog truth-sync for 023 needed root + per-phase consistency: add missing phase 013 entry and avoid overstating rerun verification for 010/011/012 while strict validation remains green [Task 5]
   789	- for packet changelog generation at this scale, first mirror prior packet changelog structure, then gather evidence from implementation summaries/checklists/review docs before drafting per-phase files [Task 6]
   790	- README formatting in this repo is partially hand-formatted; if `npx prettier --check README.md` fails but `git diff --check` is clean, keep scoped edits and avoid whole-file reflow [Task 7]

# Iteration 027: DEVELOPER EXPERIENCE

## Focus
DEVELOPER EXPERIENCE: How easy is this system to set up, configure, debug, and maintain? What DX patterns should we steal for our memory system?

## Findings
### Finding 1: Mnemosyne’s five-tool surface is the right kind of simple, but only as a thin layer over a richer core
- **Source**: `external/src/index.ts:95-202`, `external/README.md:35-60`, `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/tool-schemas.ts:41-50`, `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/tool-schemas.ts:190-220`, `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/dist/memory/generate-context.js:62-88`
- **Evidence type**: both
- **What it does**: Mnemosyne gives the agent five obvious verbs: recall, recall_global, store, store_global, delete. By contrast, Public’s core is much richer: `memory_context`, `memory_search`, `memory_quick_search`, `memory_match_triggers`, `memory_save`, JSON-primary `generate-context.js`, and governed scope fields.
- **Why it matters**: Public’s capability model is stronger, but its first-mile DX is heavier. The pattern worth stealing is not Mnemosyne’s weaker policy model; it is the idea of shipping a tiny opinionated wrapper layer on top of the real system so common actions do not require choosing among many knobs.
- **Recommendation**: adopt now
- **Affected subsystem**: memory tool ergonomics, OpenCode-facing wrapper UX
- **Impact**: high

### Finding 2: Compaction-time memory reminders are a low-cost DX win that Public still lacks
- **Source**: `external/src/index.ts:208-223`, `.opencode/plugins/spec-kit-compact-code-graph.js:323-344`, `.opencode/plugins/spec-kit-compact-code-graph.js:396-417`, `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/context-server.ts:755-788`
- **Evidence type**: wrapper-confirmed
- **What it does**: Mnemosyne injects a direct memory-usage checklist into `experimental.session.compacting`, including when to recall, store, delete, use `core`, and use global memory. Public’s compaction path currently injects structural transport context and recovery guidance, not a comparable memory-behavior reminder.
- **Why it matters**: After compaction, the hardest thing to preserve is not just context but operator habit. A direct reminder to use memory tools is better DX than expecting the model to rediscover those tools from general docs or prior system prompts.
- **Recommendation**: adopt now
- **Affected subsystem**: compaction resilience, session continuity, memory-tool discoverability
- **Impact**: high

### Finding 3: The README-shipped AGENTS snippet is a strong onboarding pattern
- **Source**: `external/README.md:62-78`, `external/src/index.ts:95-202`, `external/` tree listing
- **Evidence type**: README-documented
- **What it does**: The external repo does not ship an in-repo `AGENTS.md`; instead, it gives users a copy-paste AGENTS block that teaches the agent a simple memory discipline from session start through session end.
- **Why it matters**: This is good DX because it turns plugin installation into behavior adoption. Public already has the tools, but a lot of correct usage still depends on repo-local know-how. We should package a short “memory discipline” snippet for operators instead of assuming they will synthesize one from tool schemas.
- **Recommendation**: adopt now
- **Affected subsystem**: onboarding docs, operator setup, agent policy guidance
- **Impact**: medium

### Finding 4: Basename-derived project scoping is ergonomic, but too lossy for Public’s governed model
- **Source**: `external/src/index.ts:27-30`, `external/src/index.ts:78-90`, `external/src/index.ts:96-190`, `external/README.md:51-60`, `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/tool-schemas.ts:42-44`, `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/tool-schemas.ts:69-77`, `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/tool-schemas.ts:201-220`
- **Evidence type**: both
- **What it does**: Mnemosyne derives the project collection from the directory basename, auto-inits that collection on plugin load, and lazily creates the global collection on first global write.
- **Why it matters**: This is excellent zero-config DX, but it is too ambiguous for Public as-is. Same-basename repos, nested worktrees, and collaborative/private/shared boundaries all make basename-only scope unsafe. The reusable pattern is ergonomic aliases, not the namespace policy itself.
- **Recommendation**: prototype later
- **Affected subsystem**: scope ergonomics, wrapper aliases over governed retrieval
- **Impact**: medium

### Finding 5: The offline-first story is attractive, but the real setup path is much rougher than the plugin README makes it feel
- **Source**: `external/README.md:7-31`, `external/README.md:82-87`, `external/package.json:31-43`, `external/src/index.ts:38-75`
- **Evidence type**: both
- **What it does**: The plugin itself is tiny and easy to install in `opencode.json`, but actual runtime depends on a separately installed `mnemosyne` binary, Bun host behavior, Go/GCC/Task for source install, and a one-time model download of about 500 MB.
- **Why it matters**: This is good privacy DX and bad onboarding DX. The plugin wrapper hides a large portion of the true setup burden, and its missing-binary handling is a returned error string rather than a structured preflight. For Public, this is a warning sign: do not trade install simplicity on paper for runtime ambiguity in practice.
- **Recommendation**: reject as the default architecture for Spec Kit Memory; only consider it as an optional offline wrapper with explicit preflight checks
- **Affected subsystem**: installation, dependency management, operator onboarding
- **Impact**: high

### Finding 6: Thin wrappers still need first-class status and health surfaces
- **Source**: `external/src/index.ts:8-24`, `external/src/index.ts:38-75`, `external/src/index.ts:92-223`, `.opencode/plugins/spec-kit-compact-code-graph.js:295-318`, `.opencode/plugins/spec-kit-compact-code-graph.js:396-417`, `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/tool-schemas.ts:739-770`, `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/context-server.ts:755-788`
- **Evidence type**: both
- **What it does**: Mnemosyne logs to `client.app.log` and shells out through `Bun.spawn`, but it exposes no status tool, no readiness report, and no repair hint surface. Public already has stronger operator support patterns: `spec_kit_compact_code_graph_status`, `session_resume`, `session_bootstrap`, and explicit structural recovery guidance.
- **Why it matters**: For setup, debugging, and maintenance, logs are not enough. The best DX pattern here is actually the contrast: any future Public-facing memory wrapper should ship a one-command answer to “is it ready, what failed, and what do I do next?”
- **Recommendation**: adopt now
- **Affected subsystem**: diagnostics, operability, maintenance support
- **Impact**: high

## Assessment
- New information ratio: 0.41
- Most of the new value in this pass came from DX tradeoffs, not retrieval math. The external repo really is a very thin wrapper: `external/src/index.ts` plus packaging and README, with no visible backend internals and no local `AGENTS.md`.
- The strongest ideas to steal are: thin convenience wrappers, compaction-time memory reminders, and a copy-paste AGENTS snippet. The things not to steal are: basename-only scoping, hidden binary/model dependency burden, and lack of self-service status tooling.
- Validation: `bash .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/spec/validate.sh "/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/004-opencode-mnemosyne-main" --strict` returned `RESULT: PASSED` with `Errors: 0  Warnings: 0`; the read-only environment also emitted `cannot create temp file for here document: Operation not permitted`.

## Recommended Next Focus
Operator observability and failure-path UX: compare how external memory systems expose readiness, version skew, missing binary/model failures, repair commands, and status inspection, then define the minimum preflight/status contract for a future Public memory wrapper.
