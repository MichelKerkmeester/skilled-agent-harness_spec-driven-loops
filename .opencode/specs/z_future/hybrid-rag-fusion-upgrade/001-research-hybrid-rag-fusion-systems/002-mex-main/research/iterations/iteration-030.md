## Assessment
- New information ratio: 0.42

## Recommended Next Focus
Define a concrete `spec-kit doctor` DX surface that maps existing capabilities into one guided flow: `bootstrap -> diagnose -> repair suggestion -> optional auto-repair -> recheck -> next call hints`. The highest-value follow-up is to design that command contract around current tools we already have: `session_bootstrap`, `memory_health`, `memory_save(dryRun)`, `code_graph_scan`, `memory_index_scan`, and trace-enabled retrieval responses.

- **What it does**: Mex extracts typed markdown claims from inline code, code blocks, and dependency headings, then runs zero-token checks for missing paths, dead frontmatter edges, and `patterns/INDEX.md` drift. It already distinguishes real missing references from pattern/template placeholders by downgrading some path misses to warnings.
- **Why it matters for us**: This cleanly maps to our real gap. Spec Kit already has semantic retrieval, trigger recall, causal links, and health tooling, but it does not statically verify that markdown references still point to real files or that pattern indexes stay in sync.

### Finding 5: Mex’s core maintenance loop is detect -> build file-scoped repair brief -> fix -> recheck -> repeat
- **Source**: [mex README](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/README.md#L96), [SYNC.md](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/SYNC.md#L9), [sync/index.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/src/sync/index.ts#L29), [brief-builder.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/src/sync/brief-builder.ts#L18)
- **What it does**: Mex groups issues by file, includes current file content plus filesystem and git context, runs one repair session, then measures score delta and optionally loops again.
- **Why it matters**: This is the strongest reusable DX decision. Spec Kit has the primitives already, but not a single guided “doctor/repair” loop that owns diagnosis, suggested fix path, rerun, and stop conditions.
- **Recommendation**: NEW FEATURE
- **Impact**: high

### Finding 6: Mex grows its knowledge base from completed work through patterns and append-only decisions
- **Source**: [AGENTS.md](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/AGENTS.md#L37), [ROUTER.md](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/ROUTER.md#L64), [pattern/index.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/src/pattern/index.ts#L6), [context/decisions.md](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/context/decisions.md#L20)
- **What it does**: After work, Mex wants new task patterns added, stale context surgically updated, and old decisions preserved instead of overwritten.
- **Why it matters**: We already preserve session context and can model causal lineage, but we do not yet have an equally explicit project-pattern growth loop. That is useful, especially for repeatable operational playbooks, but it should remain secondary to indexed memory.
- **Recommendation**: prototype later
- **Impact**: medium

### Finding 7: Mex collapses scaffold health into a single score with fixed penalty weights and hardcoded staleness thresholds
- **Source**: [mex README](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/README.md#L81), [scoring.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/src/drift/scoring.ts#L3), [staleness.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/src/drift/checkers/staleness.ts#L4), [git.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/src/git.ts#L12), [reporter.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/src/reporter.ts#L16)
- **What it does**: Health is `100 - 10/error - 3/warning - 1/info`, with staleness thresholds of 30/90 days and 50/200 commits, then rendered as a single drift score.
- **Why it matters**: This is good UX for a small scaffold, but it is too lossy for Spec Kit Memory. Our system needs subsystem-specific evidence and eval-backed thresholds, not one blended score that hides whether the problem is retrieval quality, graph freshness, or markdown integrity.
- **Recommendation**: reject
- **Impact**: medium

## Assessment
- New information ratio: 0.36

## Recommended Next Focus
Design the Spec Kit policy split explicitly: keep Mex-style static drift as a separate integrity layer, not part of recall, then define the retrieval policy matrix with four outcomes: `lexical-first`, `semantic-first`, `hybrid-balanced`, and `graph-first`, plus when a future `spec-kit doctor` facade should invoke each path.

RESEARCH BRIEF:
# $refine TIDD-EC Prompt: 002-mex-main

## 2. Role

You are a research specialist in knowledge scaffold architectures, drift detection systems, markdown-based persistence, and codebase-knowledge synchronization. Work like a systems analyst who can separate scaffold design, static drift checking, and targeted AI repair loops, then translate Mex's concrete mechanisms into practical improvements for `Code_Environment/Public`.

## 3. Task

Research Mex's markdown scaffold and drift detection patterns to identify practical, evidence-backed improvements for `Code_Environment/Public`, especially around staleness detection, codebase-knowledge synchronization, and structured project knowledge. Determine which Mex patterns should be `adopt now`, `prototype later`, or `reject`.

## 4. Context

### 4.1 System Description

Mex is a structured markdown scaffold with a TypeScript/Node.js CLI for persistent AI project memory. Instead of a database, it keeps project knowledge in navigable markdown files such as `AGENTS.md`, `ROUTER.md`, `context/*.md`, and `patterns/*.md`. Its defining mechanism is drift detection: eight static checkers validate scaffold claims against the real codebase without AI or token spend. Those checkers cover path validation, frontmatter edges, pattern index consistency, staleness based on git history, command existence, dependency claims, cross-file contradictions, and script coverage. Drift starts at score `100` and deducts `-10` per error, `-3` per warning, and `-1` per info. The scaffold is designed to grow after real work through pattern creation, targeted context updates, and current-state refreshes rather than one-time setup alone.

### 4.2 Cross-Phase Awareness Table

| Phase | System | Core Pattern | Overlap Risk | Differentiation |
|-------|--------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|
| 001 | Engram | MCP memory server (Go, SQLite+FTS5) | 002 (memory persistence) | Focus tool profiles, session lifecycle, topic keys |
| 002 | Mex | Markdown scaffold + drift detection | 001 (memory), 003 (memory) | Focus drift detection, scaffold structure, no-DB approach |
| 003 | Modus Memory | FSRS spaced repetition + BM25 | 001 (FTS5), 004 (local memory) | Focus FSRS decay, cross-referencing, librarian expansion |
| 004 | OpenCode Mnemosyne | Hybrid search (FTS5 + vector) | 001 (FTS5), 003 (local memory) | Focus vector search, plugin architecture, scoping |

### 4.3 What This Repo Already Has

`Code_Environment/Public` already has Spec Kit validation via `validate.sh` with severity-oriented checks, indexed memory files with frontmatter, and a `MEMORY.md`-style documentation/memory model. What it does **not** currently have is an automated drift checker that compares documentation or memory scaffolds against the actual filesystem, commands, dependencies, git staleness, or cross-file contradictions. Research should stay centered on that gap rather than re-covering general memory persistence already addressed by phase `001`.

## 5. Instructions

1. Treat `/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main` as the pre-approved phase folder. Skip Gate 3, keep all writes inside this phase folder, and treat everything under `external/` as read-only.
2. Start with `external/mex-main/README.md`. Read the positioning, the eight-checker summary, the drift-score model, the command surface, and the documented file structure before inferring anything from implementation details.
3. Immediately after the README, inspect the scaffold contract files in this order: `external/mex-main/AGENTS.md`, `external/mex-main/ROUTER.md`, `external/mex-main/SETUP.md`, and `external/mex-main/SYNC.md`. Treat these as the canonical markdown scaffold, growth loop, and resync workflow.
4. Map the scaffold structure explicitly: project-root tool instruction file, scaffold root, `context/` files, `patterns/INDEX.md`, pattern files, and the GROW step that updates project state and creates new patterns from real work.
5. Read `external/mex-main/src/cli.ts` next. Trace the user-facing layers in order: `mex init`, `mex check`, `mex sync`, `mex pattern add`, `mex watch`, and `mex commands`. Use this to anchor later claims about the relationship between setup, drift detection, targeted sync, and scaffold growth.
6. Read `external/mex-main/src/drift/index.ts`, `src/drift/claims.ts`, `src/drift/frontmatter.ts`, and `src/drift/scoring.ts`. Understand how Mex finds scaffold files, extracts claims from markdown, parses frontmatter edges, runs checker passes, and computes the final drift score.
7. Read `external/mex-main/src/scanner/index.ts` plus the scanner modules it composes. Focus on how Mex builds a structured brief first, then instructs AI to populate scaffold files from that brief rather than from raw exploratory browsing.
8. Read `external/mex-main/src/sync/brief-builder.ts` and `src/pattern/index.ts`. Study how Mex turns drift issues into targeted repair prompts, supplies filesystem and git context, and appends new patterns into the scaffold instead of treating documentation as static.
9. Examine the first three drift checkers individually: `src/drift/checkers/path.ts`, `src/drift/checkers/edges.ts`, and `src/drift/checkers/index-sync.ts`. Document the actual detection logic, severity behavior, placeholder handling, and what kind of documentation drift each checker catches.
10. Examine the next three drift checkers individually: `src/drift/checkers/staleness.ts`, `src/drift/checkers/command.ts`, and `src/drift/checkers/dependency.ts`. Capture the exact thresholds and matching rules, including how staleness uses both days and commit counts, how commands are validated, and how dependency claims are compared to manifests.
11. Examine the final two drift checkers individually: `src/drift/checkers/cross-file.ts` and `src/drift/checkers/script-coverage.ts`. Explain how Mex detects contradictions across scaffold files and how it checks whether real scripts are missing from the scaffold narrative.
12. Compare Mex directly against current `Code_Environment/Public` capabilities: Spec Kit validation, memory frontmatter, documented memory/index structure, and other repo guidance files. Be precise about where Mex adds new capability versus where it overlaps with systems already covered by phases `001`, `003`, or `004`.
13. Before any deep-research run, ensure this phase folder contains the expected spec-kit docs for the chosen level. Validate the phase folder with:
    ```bash
    cd /Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public && bash .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/spec/validate.sh "/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main" --strict
    ```
14. After validation passes, run deep research using this exact topic:
    ```text
    Research the external repository at /Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/mex-main and identify concrete improvements for Code_Environment/Public, especially around knowledge scaffold design, drift detection, staleness checking, codebase-knowledge synchronization, and structured project memory.
    ```
15. Save all outputs inside this phase folder, especially under `research/`. Every finding must cite exact file paths, describe what Mex actually does, why it matters for `Code_Environment/Public`, whether it should be `adopt now`, `prototype later`, or `reject`, what subsystem it would affect, and what migration or validation risk comes with it. When research is complete, update `checklist.md`, create `implementation-summary.md`, and save memory with:
    ```bash
    cd /Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public && node .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/dist/memory/generate-context.js "/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main"
    ```

## 6. Research Questions

1. How does Mex's markdown-first scaffold change the tradeoff between navigability, editability, and correctness compared with database-backed memory systems?
2. How do the eight drift checkers compose into a practical health model, and where are the blind spots between checker coverage and actual scaffold truthfulness?
3. Are Mex's staleness thresholds (`30` warning days, `90` error days, `50` warning commits, `200` error commits) reasonable defaults, and how might similar thresholds be calibrated for `Code_Environment/Public`?
4. What makes Mex's path, edge, and index-sync checks useful as low-cost documentation integrity guards, and which of those ideas translate cleanly into Spec Kit?
5. How effective is the scoring model (`100 - 10/error - 3/warning - 1/info`) as a developer-facing health metric, and would `Code_Environment/Public` benefit from a comparable score or from severity-only reporting?
6. How does Mex's claim extraction model work in practice, especially its distinction between paths, commands, dependencies, and versions pulled from markdown?
7. What does Mex gain by checking real scripts that are undocumented in the scaffold, and how does that differ from existing `validate.sh` checks in this repo?
8. How does Mex's targeted sync flow convert static drift findings into precise AI repair prompts, and could `Code_Environment/Public` adopt a similar "fix only what's broken" pattern?
9. How do Mex's GROW rules and `pattern add` workflow support scaffold auto-growth after tasks rather than only during initialization?
10. What are the strongest arguments for keeping some project knowledge in markdown even when richer search or database systems exist elsewhere in the stack?

## 7. Do's

- Do examine each of the eight drift checkers individually rather than relying on the README summary alone.
- Do study the scoring algorithm and relate score behavior to developer incentives and operational clarity.
- Do analyze how scaffold growth happens after tasks through GROW rules, `pattern add`, targeted sync, and current-state updates.
- Do compare Mex's drift logic directly against `Code_Environment/Public` validation and memory/documentation surfaces.
- Do separate static drift detection from AI-assisted repair; they are distinct layers in Mex.
- Do highlight which Mex ideas help codebase-knowledge synchronization without requiring a database.
- Do address overlap with phase `001` explicitly so this phase stays focused on drift detection and scaffold design rather than generic persistence.

## 8. Don'ts

- Do not focus the research on npm packaging, build tooling, or release mechanics.
- Do not dismiss the markdown approach as primitive; markdown is the core persistence decision under evaluation.
- Do not confuse drift detection with AI-based validation or sync; the checkers are zero-token static analysis.
- Do not let README prose overrule source evidence from `src/`.
- Do not recommend importing Mex wholesale if the reusable value is only a subset of its design.
- Do not collapse this phase into memory-persistence comparisons already owned by phase `001`.
- Do not edit anything under `external/` or outside this phase folder.

## 9. Examples

### Example A: Staleness-checking finding

`src/drift/checkers/staleness.ts` does not rely on human judgment alone; it flags scaffold files by both elapsed days and commits since last change. A strong finding would explain why combining temporal and repository-activity signals is stronger than date-only freshness, show how that could improve Public's documentation hygiene, and classify the idea as `adopt now`, `prototype later`, or `reject`.

### Example B: Drift-detection composition finding

Mex does not use one monolithic "docs are wrong" check. `path.ts`, `edges.ts`, `index-sync.ts`, `command.ts`, `dependency.ts`, `cross-file.ts`, and `script-coverage.ts` each catch a different failure mode. A strong finding would describe how those checks work together, identify which subset would most improve `Code_Environment/Public`, and explain where Spec Kit validation already covers adjacent concerns.

## 10. Constraints

### 10.1 Error handling

- If a README claim cannot be verified in `src/`, mark it as unverified instead of repeating it as fact.
- If a checker behaves differently from the README summary, prefer the source code and call out the discrepancy explicitly.
- If a file path inside the external repo is missing, say so plainly and continue with the remaining evidence rather than guessing.
- If the external repo structure changes from the paths named here, adjust the reading path but preserve the same analytical order.

### 10.2 Scope

**IN SCOPE**

- scaffold structure and navigation model
- markdown persistence design
- all eight drift checkers
- scoring and health reporting
- staleness thresholds and git-based freshness signals
- targeted sync prompt generation
- scaffold auto-growth and pattern creation
- comparison with `Code_Environment/Public` validation and memory surfaces

**OUT OF SCOPE**

- generic Node.js packaging analysis
- benchmarking build performance
- speculative database redesigns not grounded in Mex evidence
- unrelated hybrid-RAG implementation details
- re-litigating memory persistence questions already owned by phase `001`

### 10.3 Prioritization framework

Rank findings in this order: drift-detection value for `Code_Environment/Public`, documentation-to-code synchronization impact, scaffold simplicity-to-maintainability ratio, staleness-signal usefulness, compatibility with existing Spec Kit workflows, implementation cost, and cross-phase differentiation from phases `001`, `003`, and `004`.

## 11. Deliverables

- `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`, and any level-required spec docs present and valid before deep research starts
- `research/research.md` as the canonical report with at least 5 evidence-backed findings
- explicit comparison between Mex and current `Code_Environment/Public` documentation/memory validation capabilities
- findings that classify each recommendation as `adopt now`, `prototype later`, or `reject`
- `implementation-summary.md` created at the end
- memory saved from this phase folder using `generate-context.js`

Minimum finding schema:

- finding title
- exact source evidence
- what Mex does
- why it matters for `Code_Environment/Public`
- recommendation: `adopt now`, `prototype later`, or `reject`
- affected subsystem
- migration risk, false-positive risk, or validation requirement

## 12. Evaluation Criteria

- CLEAR target: `>= 40/50`
- RICCE compliance is visible in the prompt:
  - **Role** is specialized in scaffold architecture, drift detection, markdown persistence, and synchronization
  - **Instructions** are ordered, concrete, and path-specific
  - **Context** is domain-specific and cross-phase aware
  - **Constraints** clearly limit scope and error handling
  - **Examples** show what strong Mex findings look like
- at least 5 findings are evidence-backed rather than speculative
- findings analyze both the benefits and limitations of markdown-first persistence
- findings compare Mex's static drift detection against existing `validate.sh` behavior rather than treating them as interchangeable
- overlap with phase `001` is explicitly resolved so this phase stays focused on drift detection and scaffold design

## 13. Completion Bar

The phase is only complete when all of the following are true:

- the reading order covered README, scaffold contract files, CLI flow, drift engine, targeted sync, and all eight checker implementations
- the validation command passed on this exact phase folder
- `research/research.md` contains at least 5 evidence-backed findings
- `checklist.md` is updated with evidence and completion marks
- `implementation-summary.md` exists
- memory is saved successfully for `002-mex-main`
- no edits were made outside the phase folder
- recommendations explicitly address staleness detection, codebase-knowledge synchronization, and structured project knowledge
- cross-phase overlap with phase `001` is explicitly addressed and bounded

# Autonomous Deep Research Loop

Iterative research protocol with fresh context per iteration, externalized state, and convergence detection for deep technical investigation.

Runtime path resolution:
- OpenCode/Copilot runtime: `.opencode/agent/*.md`
- Claude runtime: `.claude/agents/*.md`
- Codex runtime: `.codex/agents/*.toml`

<!-- ANCHOR:when-to-use -->
## 1. WHEN TO USE

### When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Deep investigation requiring multiple rounds of discovery
- Topic spans 3+ technical domains or sources
- Initial findings need progressive refinement
- Overnight or unattended research sessions
- Research where prior findings inform subsequent queries

### When NOT to Use

- Simple, single-question research (use direct codebase search or `/spec_kit:plan`)
- Known-solution documentation (use `/spec_kit:plan`)
- Implementation tasks (use `/spec_kit:implement`)
- Quick codebase searches (use `@context` or direct Grep/Glob)
- Fewer than 3 sources needed (single-pass research suffices)

### Keyword Triggers

`autoresearch`, `deep research`, `autonomous research`, `research loop`, `iterative research`, `multi-round research`, `deep investigation`, `comprehensive research`

For iterative code review and quality auditing, see `sk-deep-review`.

### Lifecycle Contract

Live lifecycle branches:
- `resume` — continue the active lineage
- `restart` — start a new generation with explicit parent linkage
- `fork` — branch from the current packet state
- `completed-continue` — reopen a completed lineage only after immutable synthesis snapshotting

## 2. SMART ROUTING

### Resource Loading Levels

| Level | When to Load | Resources |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| ALWAYS | Every skill invocation | Quick reference baseline |
| CONDITIONAL | If intent signals match | Loop protocol, convergence, state format |
| ON_DEMAND | Only on explicit request | Templates, detailed specifications |

}
```

### Scoped Guard

```python
def _guard_in_skill():
    """Verify this skill is active before loading resources."""
    if not hasattr(_guard_in_skill, '_active'):
        _guard_in_skill._active = True
    return _guard_in_skill._active

def discover_markdown_resources(base_path: Path) -> list[str]:
    """Discover all .md files in the assets directory."""
    return sorted(str(p.relative_to(base_path)) for p in (base_path / "references").glob("*.md"))
```

### Phase Detection

Detect the current research phase from dispatch context to load appropriate resources:

| Phase | Signal | Resources to Load |
|-------|--------|-------------------|
| Init | No JSONL exists | Loop protocol, state format |
| Iteration | Dispatch context includes iteration number | Loop protocol, convergence |
| Stuck | Dispatch context includes "RECOVERY" | Convergence, loop protocol |
| Synthesis | Convergence triggered STOP | Quick reference |

### Core Innovation: Fresh Context Per Iteration

Each agent dispatch gets a fresh context window. State continuity comes from files, not memory. This solves context degradation in long research sessions.

Adapted from: karpathy/autoresearch (loop concept), AGR (fresh context "Ralph Loop"), pi-autoresearch (JSONL state), autoresearch-opencode (context injection).

### Data Flow

```
Init --> Create config.json, strategy.md, state.jsonl
  |
Loop --> Read state --> Check convergence --> Dispatch @deep-research
  |                                              |
  |                                              v
  |                                         Agent executes:
  |                                         1. Read state files
  |                                         2. Determine focus
  |                                         3. Research (3-5 actions)
  |                                         4. Write iteration-NNN.md
  |                                         5. Update strategy.md
  |                                         6. Append state.jsonl
  |                                              |
  +<--- Evaluate results <-----------------------+
  |
  +--- Continue? --> Yes: next iteration
  |                  No: exit loop
  v
Synthesize --> Compile final research/research.md
  |
Save --> generate-context.js --> verify memory artifact
```

### Key Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Externalized state** | All research continuity via files, not agent memory |
| **Fresh context** | Each iteration gets a clean agent with no prior context |
| **Convergence** | Multi-signal detection: newInfoRatio, stuck count, questions answered |
| **Strategy file** | Reducer-synchronized research steering with machine-owned sections |
| **JSONL log** | Append-only structured log for lineage and iteration data |
| **Findings registry** | Reducer-owned open/resolved questions, key findings, and ruled-out directions |

I’ve confirmed the phase folder and the deep-research skill contract. Next I’m reading the existing research artifacts and the current report so the final synthesis reflects what’s already been established instead of inventing a fresh classification.

## 2. Role

You are a research specialist in knowledge scaffold architectures, drift detection systems, markdown-based persistence, and codebase-knowledge synchronization. Work like a systems analyst who can separate scaffold design, static drift checking, and targeted AI repair loops, then translate Mex's concrete mechanisms into practical improvements for `Code_Environment/Public`.

## 3. Task

Research Mex's markdown scaffold and drift detection patterns to identify practical, evidence-backed improvements for `Code_Environment/Public`, especially around staleness detection, codebase-knowledge synchronization, and structured project knowledge. Determine which Mex patterns should be `adopt now`, `prototype later`, or `reject`.

## 4. Context

### 4.1 System Description

Mex is a structured markdown scaffold with a TypeScript/Node.js CLI for persistent AI project memory. Instead of a database, it keeps project knowledge in navigable markdown files such as `AGENTS.md`, `ROUTER.md`, `context/*.md`, and `patterns/*.md`. Its defining mechanism is drift detection: eight static checkers validate scaffold claims against the real codebase without AI or token spend. Those checkers cover path validation, frontmatter edges, pattern index consistency, staleness based on git history, command existence, dependency claims, cross-file contradictions, and script coverage. Drift starts at score `100` and deducts `-10` per error, `-3` per warning, and `-1` per info. The scaffold is designed to grow after real work through pattern creation, targeted context updates, and current-state refreshes rather than one-time setup alone.

### 4.2 Cross-Phase Awareness Table

| Phase | System | Core Pattern | Overlap Risk | Differentiation |
|-------|--------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|
| 001 | Engram | MCP memory server (Go, SQLite+FTS5) | 002 (memory persistence) | Focus tool profiles, session lifecycle, topic keys |
| 002 | Mex | Markdown scaffold + drift detection | 001 (memory), 003 (memory) | Focus drift detection, scaffold structure, no-DB approach |
| 003 | Modus Memory | FSRS spaced repetition + BM25 | 001 (FTS5), 004 (local memory) | Focus FSRS decay, cross-referencing, librarian expansion |
| 004 | OpenCode Mnemosyne | Hybrid search (FTS5 + vector) | 001 (FTS5), 003 (local memory) | Focus vector search, plugin architecture, scoping |

### 4.3 What This Repo Already Has

`Code_Environment/Public` already has Spec Kit validation via `validate.sh` with severity-oriented checks, indexed memory files with frontmatter, and a `MEMORY.md`-style documentation/memory model. What it does **not** currently have is an automated drift checker that compares documentation or memory scaffolds against the actual filesystem, commands, dependencies, git staleness, or cross-file contradictions. Research should stay centered on that gap rather than re-covering general memory persistence already addressed by phase `001`.

## 5. Instructions

1. Treat `/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main` as the pre-approved phase folder. Skip Gate 3, keep all writes inside this phase folder, and treat everything under `external/` as read-only.
2. Start with `external/mex-main/README.md`. Read the positioning, the eight-checker summary, the drift-score model, the command surface, and the documented file structure before inferring anything from implementation details.
3. Immediately after the README, inspect the scaffold contract files in this order: `external/mex-main/AGENTS.md`, `external/mex-main/ROUTER.md`, `external/mex-main/SETUP.md`, and `external/mex-main/SYNC.md`. Treat these as the canonical markdown scaffold, growth loop, and resync workflow.
4. Map the scaffold structure explicitly: project-root tool instruction file, scaffold root, `context/` files, `patterns/INDEX.md`, pattern files, and the GROW step that updates project state and creates new patterns from real work.
5. Read `external/mex-main/src/cli.ts` next. Trace the user-facing layers in order: `mex init`, `mex check`, `mex sync`, `mex pattern add`, `mex watch`, and `mex commands`. Use this to anchor later claims about the relationship between setup, drift detection, targeted sync, and scaffold growth.
6. Read `external/mex-main/src/drift/index.ts`, `src/drift/claims.ts`, `src/drift/frontmatter.ts`, and `src/drift/scoring.ts`. Understand how Mex finds scaffold files, extracts claims from markdown, parses frontmatter edges, runs checker passes, and computes the final drift score.
7. Read `external/mex-main/src/scanner/index.ts` plus the scanner modules it composes. Focus on how Mex builds a structured brief first, then instructs AI to populate scaffold files from that brief rather than from raw exploratory browsing.
8. Read `external/mex-main/src/sync/brief-builder.ts` and `src/pattern/index.ts`. Study how Mex turns drift issues into targeted repair prompts, supplies filesystem and git context, and appends new patterns into the scaffold instead of treating documentation as static.
9. Examine the first three drift checkers individually: `src/drift/checkers/path.ts`, `src/drift/checkers/edges.ts`, and `src/drift/checkers/index-sync.ts`. Document the actual detection logic, severity behavior, placeholder handling, and what kind of documentation drift each checker catches.
10. Examine the next three drift checkers individually: `src/drift/checkers/staleness.ts`, `src/drift/checkers/command.ts`, and `src/drift/checkers/dependency.ts`. Capture the exact thresholds and matching rules, including how staleness uses both days and commit counts, how commands are validated, and how dependency claims are compared to manifests.
11. Examine the final two drift checkers individually: `src/drift/checkers/cross-file.ts` and `src/drift/checkers/script-coverage.ts`. Explain how Mex detects contradictions across scaffold files and how it checks whether real scripts are missing from the scaffold narrative.
12. Compare Mex directly against current `Code_Environment/Public` capabilities: Spec Kit validation, memory frontmatter, documented memory/index structure, and other repo guidance files. Be precise about where Mex adds new capability versus where it overlaps with systems already covered by phases `001`, `003`, or `004`.
13. Before any deep-research run, ensure this phase folder contains the expected spec-kit docs for the chosen level. Validate the phase folder with:
    ```bash
    cd /Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public && bash .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/spec/validate.sh "/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main" --strict
    ```
14. After validation passes, run deep research using this exact topic:
    ```text
    Research the external repository at /Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/mex-main and identify concrete improvements for Code_Environment/Public, especially around knowledge scaffold design, drift detection, staleness checking, codebase-knowledge synchronization, and structured project memory.
    ```
15. Save all outputs inside this phase folder, especially under `research/`. Every finding must cite exact file paths, describe what Mex actually does, why it matters for `Code_Environment/Public`, whether it should be `adopt now`, `prototype later`, or `reject`, what subsystem it would affect, and what migration or validation risk comes with it. When research is complete, update `checklist.md`, create `implementation-summary.md`, and save memory with:
    ```bash
    cd /Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public && node .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/dist/memory/generate-context.js "/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main"
    ```

## 6. Research Questions

1. How does Mex's markdown-first scaffold change the tradeoff between navigability, editability, and correctness compared with database-backed memory systems?
2. How do the eight drift checkers compose into a practical health model, and where are the blind spots between checker coverage and actual scaffold truthfulness?
3. Are Mex's staleness thresholds (`30` warning days, `90` error days, `50` warning commits, `200` error commits) reasonable defaults, and how might similar thresholds be calibrated for `Code_Environment/Public`?
4. What makes Mex's path, edge, and index-sync checks useful as low-cost documentation integrity guards, and which of those ideas translate cleanly into Spec Kit?
5. How effective is the scoring model (`100 - 10/error - 3/warning - 1/info`) as a developer-facing health metric, and would `Code_Environment/Public` benefit from a comparable score or from severity-only reporting?
6. How does Mex's claim extraction model work in practice, especially its distinction between paths, commands, dependencies, and versions pulled from markdown?
7. What does Mex gain by checking real scripts that are undocumented in the scaffold, and how does that differ from existing `validate.sh` checks in this repo?
8. How does Mex's targeted sync flow convert static drift findings into precise AI repair prompts, and could `Code_Environment/Public` adopt a similar "fix only what's broken" pattern?
9. How do Mex's GROW rules and `pattern add` workflow support scaffold auto-growth after tasks rather than only during initialization?
10. What are the strongest arguments for keeping some project knowledge in markdown even when richer search or database systems exist elsewhere in the stack?

## 7. Do's

- Do examine each of the eight drift checkers individually rather than relying on the README summary alone.
- Do study the scoring algorithm and relate score behavior to developer incentives and operational clarity.
- Do analyze how scaffold growth happens after tasks through GROW rules, `pattern add`, targeted sync, and current-state updates.
- Do compare Mex's drift logic directly against `Code_Environment/Public` validation and memory/documentation surfaces.
- Do separate static drift detection from AI-assisted repair; they are distinct layers in Mex.
- Do highlight which Mex ideas help codebase-knowledge synchronization without requiring a database.
- Do address overlap with phase `001` explicitly so this phase stays focused on drift detection and scaffold design rather than generic persistence.

## 8. Don'ts

- Do not focus the research on npm packaging, build tooling, or release mechanics.
- Do not dismiss the markdown approach as primitive; markdown is the core persistence decision under evaluation.
- Do not confuse drift detection with AI-based validation or sync; the checkers are zero-token static analysis.
- Do not let README prose overrule source evidence from `src/`.
- Do not recommend importing Mex wholesale if the reusable value is only a subset of its design.
- Do not collapse this phase into memory-persistence comparisons already owned by phase `001`.
- Do not edit anything under `external/` or outside this phase folder.

## 9. Examples

### Example A: Staleness-checking finding

`src/drift/checkers/staleness.ts` does not rely on human judgment alone; it flags scaffold files by both elapsed days and commits since last change. A strong finding would explain why combining temporal and repository-activity signals is stronger than date-only freshness, show how that could improve Public's documentation hygiene, and classify the idea as `adopt now`, `prototype later`, or `reject`.

### Example B: Drift-detection composition finding

Mex does not use one monolithic "docs are wrong" check. `path.ts`, `edges.ts`, `index-sync.ts`, `command.ts`, `dependency.ts`, `cross-file.ts`, and `script-coverage.ts` each catch a different failure mode. A strong finding would describe how those checks work together, identify which subset would most improve `Code_Environment/Public`, and explain where Spec Kit validation already covers adjacent concerns.

## 10. Constraints

### 10.1 Error handling

- If a README claim cannot be verified in `src/`, mark it as unverified instead of repeating it as fact.
- If a checker behaves differently from the README summary, prefer the source code and call out the discrepancy explicitly.
- If a file path inside the external repo is missing, say so plainly and continue with the remaining evidence rather than guessing.
- If the external repo structure changes from the paths named here, adjust the reading path but preserve the same analytical order.

### 10.2 Scope

**IN SCOPE**

- scaffold structure and navigation model
- markdown persistence design
- all eight drift checkers
- scoring and health reporting
- staleness thresholds and git-based freshness signals
- targeted sync prompt generation
- scaffold auto-growth and pattern creation
- comparison with `Code_Environment/Public` validation and memory surfaces

**OUT OF SCOPE**

- generic Node.js packaging analysis
- benchmarking build performance
- speculative database redesigns not grounded in Mex evidence
- unrelated hybrid-RAG implementation details
- re-litigating memory persistence questions already owned by phase `001`

### 10.3 Prioritization framework

Rank findings in this order: drift-detection value for `Code_Environment/Public`, documentation-to-code synchronization impact, scaffold simplicity-to-maintainability ratio, staleness-signal usefulness, compatibility with existing Spec Kit workflows, implementation cost, and cross-phase differentiation from phases `001`, `003`, and `004`.

## 11. Deliverables

- `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`, and any level-required spec docs present and valid before deep research starts
- `research/research.md` as the canonical report with at least 5 evidence-backed findings
- explicit comparison between Mex and current `Code_Environment/Public` documentation/memory validation capabilities
- findings that classify each recommendation as `adopt now`, `prototype later`, or `reject`
- `implementation-summary.md` created at the end
- memory saved from this phase folder using `generate-context.js`

Minimum finding schema:

- finding title
- exact source evidence
- what Mex does
- why it matters for `Code_Environment/Public`
- recommendation: `adopt now`, `prototype later`, or `reject`
- affected subsystem
- migration risk, false-positive risk, or validation requirement

## 12. Evaluation Criteria

- CLEAR target: `>= 40/50`
- RICCE compliance is visible in the prompt:
  - **Role** is specialized in scaffold architecture, drift detection, markdown persistence, and synchronization
  - **Instructions** are ordered, concrete, and path-specific
  - **Context** is domain-specific and cross-phase aware
  - **Constraints** clearly limit scope and error handling
  - **Examples** show what strong Mex findings look like
- at least 5 findings are evidence-backed rather than speculative
- findings analyze both the benefits and limitations of markdown-first persistence
- findings compare Mex's static drift detection against existing `validate.sh` behavior rather than treating them as interchangeable
- overlap with phase `001` is explicitly resolved so this phase stays focused on drift detection and scaffold design

## 13. Completion Bar

The phase is only complete when all of the following are true:

- the reading order covered README, scaffold contract files, CLI flow, drift engine, targeted sync, and all eight checker implementations
- the validation command passed on this exact phase folder
- `research/research.md` contains at least 5 evidence-backed findings
- `checklist.md` is updated with evidence and completion marks
- `implementation-summary.md` exists
- memory is saved successfully for `002-mex-main`
- no edits were made outside the phase folder
- recommendations explicitly address staleness detection, codebase-knowledge synchronization, and structured project knowledge
- cross-phase overlap with phase `001` is explicitly addressed and bounded

The phase already has iteration files through `029`, so I’m using those as the research ledger and checking them against the actual external source before locking the final recommendation set. That should let me update the classification cleanly instead of just repeating the earlier 20-iteration report.

## Assessment
- New information ratio: 0.77
- Questions addressed: impact-ranked subset selection; which Mex mechanisms survive contact with Spec Kit’s trust model; where false-positive risk becomes too high; what a realistic adoption sequence looks like.
- Questions answered: the only clear `adopt now` item is static reference integrity built on typed claim extraction. Freshness is the next best candidate, but only with explicit degraded/unknown semantics. Repair briefing is worth building as a new Spec Kit feature. Command/dependency/script parity needs a separate inventory abstraction first. Auto-growth and a single drift score should stay out.

## Reflection
- What worked: tracing source in execution order and pairing checker implementations with tests made the real boundaries obvious very quickly.
- What did not work: the CocoIndex semantic pass did not produce usable output in this run, so the final ranking stayed grounded in direct source tracing. The strict phase validation passed, but the script emitted a sandbox warning about creating a temp here-doc file before finishing with `Errors: 0 Warnings: 0 RESULT: PASSED`.

## Recommended Next Focus
1. Sprint 1: ship a narrow `validate.sh` or `memory_health` extension for packet-local `path`/`edge`/`index` integrity only, with severity-first reporting and no composite score.
2. Sprint 2: prototype freshness as a supplemental signal with `exact` vs `unknown/degraded` provenance, using both days and commit-count thresholds and explicit git-failure surfacing.
3. Sprint 3: build a provider-neutral repair-brief generator that consumes failed checks and emits auditable, packet-local fix briefs instead of launching an interactive CLI loop.
4. Defer until after those land: broader command/dependency/coverage audits, and only after a shared inventory model exists across npm, Python, shell, MCP commands, wrappers, and spec docs.
5. Keep rejected: automatic pattern/context growth from task completion, and any single-number health score as the primary truth surface.

- **What it does**: Mex extracts typed markdown claims from inline code, code blocks, and dependency headings, then runs zero-token checks for missing paths, dead frontmatter edges, and `patterns/INDEX.md` drift. It already distinguishes real missing references from pattern/template placeholders by downgrading some path misses to warnings.
- **Why it matters for us**: This cleanly maps to our real gap. Spec Kit already has semantic retrieval, trigger recall, causal links, and health tooling, but it does not statically verify that markdown references still point to real files or that pattern indexes stay in sync.
- **Recommendation**: adopt now
- **Impact**: high

RESEARCH BRIEF:
# $refine TIDD-EC Prompt: 002-mex-main

## 2. Role

You are a research specialist in knowledge scaffold architectures, drift detection systems, markdown-based persistence, and codebase-knowledge synchronization. Work like a systems analyst who can separate scaffold design, static drift checking, and targeted AI repair loops, then translate Mex's concrete mechanisms into practical improvements for `Code_Environment/Public`.

## 3. Task

Research Mex's markdown scaffold and drift detection patterns to identify practical, evidence-backed improvements for `Code_Environment/Public`, especially around staleness detection, codebase-knowledge synchronization, and structured project knowledge. Determine which Mex patterns should be `adopt now`, `prototype later`, or `reject`.

## 4. Context

### 4.1 System Description

Mex is a structured markdown scaffold with a TypeScript/Node.js CLI for persistent AI project memory. Instead of a database, it keeps project knowledge in navigable markdown files such as `AGENTS.md`, `ROUTER.md`, `context/*.md`, and `patterns/*.md`. Its defining mechanism is drift detection: eight static checkers validate scaffold claims against the real codebase without AI or token spend. Those checkers cover path validation, frontmatter edges, pattern index consistency, staleness based on git history, command existence, dependency claims, cross-file contradictions, and script coverage. Drift starts at score `100` and deducts `-10` per error, `-3` per warning, and `-1` per info. The scaffold is designed to grow after real work through pattern creation, targeted context updates, and current-state refreshes rather than one-time setup alone.

### 4.2 Cross-Phase Awareness Table

| Phase | System | Core Pattern | Overlap Risk | Differentiation |
|-------|--------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|
| 001 | Engram | MCP memory server (Go, SQLite+FTS5) | 002 (memory persistence) | Focus tool profiles, session lifecycle, topic keys |
| 002 | Mex | Markdown scaffold + drift detection | 001 (memory), 003 (memory) | Focus drift detection, scaffold structure, no-DB approach |
| 003 | Modus Memory | FSRS spaced repetition + BM25 | 001 (FTS5), 004 (local memory) | Focus FSRS decay, cross-referencing, librarian expansion |
| 004 | OpenCode Mnemosyne | Hybrid search (FTS5 + vector) | 001 (FTS5), 003 (local memory) | Focus vector search, plugin architecture, scoping |

### 4.3 What This Repo Already Has

`Code_Environment/Public` already has Spec Kit validation via `validate.sh` with severity-oriented checks, indexed memory files with frontmatter, and a `MEMORY.md`-style documentation/memory model. What it does **not** currently have is an automated drift checker that compares documentation or memory scaffolds against the actual filesystem, commands, dependencies, git staleness, or cross-file contradictions. Research should stay centered on that gap rather than re-covering general memory persistence already addressed by phase `001`.

## 5. Instructions

1. Treat `/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main` as the pre-approved phase folder. Skip Gate 3, keep all writes inside this phase folder, and treat everything under `external/` as read-only.
2. Start with `external/mex-main/README.md`. Read the positioning, the eight-checker summary, the drift-score model, the command surface, and the documented file structure before inferring anything from implementation details.
3. Immediately after the README, inspect the scaffold contract files in this order: `external/mex-main/AGENTS.md`, `external/mex-main/ROUTER.md`, `external/mex-main/SETUP.md`, and `external/mex-main/SYNC.md`. Treat these as the canonical markdown scaffold, growth loop, and resync workflow.
4. Map the scaffold structure explicitly: project-root tool instruction file, scaffold root, `context/` files, `patterns/INDEX.md`, pattern files, and the GROW step that updates project state and creates new patterns from real work.
5. Read `external/mex-main/src/cli.ts` next. Trace the user-facing layers in order: `mex init`, `mex check`, `mex sync`, `mex pattern add`, `mex watch`, and `mex commands`. Use this to anchor later claims about the relationship between setup, drift detection, targeted sync, and scaffold growth.
6. Read `external/mex-main/src/drift/index.ts`, `src/drift/claims.ts`, `src/drift/frontmatter.ts`, and `src/drift/scoring.ts`. Understand how Mex finds scaffold files, extracts claims from markdown, parses frontmatter edges, runs checker passes, and computes the final drift score.
7. Read `external/mex-main/src/scanner/index.ts` plus the scanner modules it composes. Focus on how Mex builds a structured brief first, then instructs AI to populate scaffold files from that brief rather than from raw exploratory browsing.
8. Read `external/mex-main/src/sync/brief-builder.ts` and `src/pattern/index.ts`. Study how Mex turns drift issues into targeted repair prompts, supplies filesystem and git context, and appends new patterns into the scaffold instead of treating documentation as static.
9. Examine the first three drift checkers individually: `src/drift/checkers/path.ts`, `src/drift/checkers/edges.ts`, and `src/drift/checkers/index-sync.ts`. Document the actual detection logic, severity behavior, placeholder handling, and what kind of documentation drift each checker catches.
10. Examine the next three drift checkers individually: `src/drift/checkers/staleness.ts`, `src/drift/checkers/command.ts`, and `src/drift/checkers/dependency.ts`. Capture the exact thresholds and matching rules, including how staleness uses both days and commit counts, how commands are validated, and how dependency claims are compared to manifests.
11. Examine the final two drift checkers individually: `src/drift/checkers/cross-file.ts` and `src/drift/checkers/script-coverage.ts`. Explain how Mex detects contradictions across scaffold files and how it checks whether real scripts are missing from the scaffold narrative.
12. Compare Mex directly against current `Code_Environment/Public` capabilities: Spec Kit validation, memory frontmatter, documented memory/index structure, and other repo guidance files. Be precise about where Mex adds new capability versus where it overlaps with systems already covered by phases `001`, `003`, or `004`.
13. Before any deep-research run, ensure this phase folder contains the expected spec-kit docs for the chosen level. Validate the phase folder with:
    ```bash
    cd /Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public && bash .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/spec/validate.sh "/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main" --strict
    ```
14. After validation passes, run deep research using this exact topic:
    ```text
    Research the external repository at /Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/mex-main and identify concrete improvements for Code_Environment/Public, especially around knowledge scaffold design, drift detection, staleness checking, codebase-knowledge synchronization, and structured project memory.
    ```
15. Save all outputs inside this phase folder, especially under `research/`. Every finding must cite exact file paths, describe what Mex actually does, why it matters for `Code_Environment/Public`, whether it should be `adopt now`, `prototype later`, or `reject`, what subsystem it would affect, and what migration or validation risk comes with it. When research is complete, update `checklist.md`, create `implementation-summary.md`, and save memory with:
    ```bash
    cd /Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public && node .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/dist/memory/generate-context.js "/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main"
    ```

## 6. Research Questions

1. How does Mex's markdown-first scaffold change the tradeoff between navigability, editability, and correctness compared with database-backed memory systems?
2. How do the eight drift checkers compose into a practical health model, and where are the blind spots between checker coverage and actual scaffold truthfulness?
3. Are Mex's staleness thresholds (`30` warning days, `90` error days, `50` warning commits, `200` error commits) reasonable defaults, and how might similar thresholds be calibrated for `Code_Environment/Public`?
4. What makes Mex's path, edge, and index-sync checks useful as low-cost documentation integrity guards, and which of those ideas translate cleanly into Spec Kit?
5. How effective is the scoring model (`100 - 10/error - 3/warning - 1/info`) as a developer-facing health metric, and would `Code_Environment/Public` benefit from a comparable score or from severity-only reporting?
6. How does Mex's claim extraction model work in practice, especially its distinction between paths, commands, dependencies, and versions pulled from markdown?
7. What does Mex gain by checking real scripts that are undocumented in the scaffold, and how does that differ from existing `validate.sh` checks in this repo?
8. How does Mex's targeted sync flow convert static drift findings into precise AI repair prompts, and could `Code_Environment/Public` adopt a similar "fix only what's broken" pattern?
9. How do Mex's GROW rules and `pattern add` workflow support scaffold auto-growth after tasks rather than only during initialization?
10. What are the strongest arguments for keeping some project knowledge in markdown even when richer search or database systems exist elsewhere in the stack?

## 7. Do's

- Do examine each of the eight drift checkers individually rather than relying on the README summary alone.
- Do study the scoring algorithm and relate score behavior to developer incentives and operational clarity.
- Do analyze how scaffold growth happens after tasks through GROW rules, `pattern add`, targeted sync, and current-state updates.
- Do compare Mex's drift logic directly against `Code_Environment/Public` validation and memory/documentation surfaces.
- Do separate static drift detection from AI-assisted repair; they are distinct layers in Mex.
- Do highlight which Mex ideas help codebase-knowledge synchronization without requiring a database.
- Do address overlap with phase `001` explicitly so this phase stays focused on drift detection and scaffold design rather than generic persistence.

## 8. Don'ts

- Do not focus the research on npm packaging, build tooling, or release mechanics.
- Do not dismiss the markdown approach as primitive; markdown is the core persistence decision under evaluation.
- Do not confuse drift detection with AI-based validation or sync; the checkers are zero-token static analysis.
- Do not let README prose overrule source evidence from `src/`.
- Do not recommend importing Mex wholesale if the reusable value is only a subset of its design.
- Do not collapse this phase into memory-persistence comparisons already owned by phase `001`.
- Do not edit anything under `external/` or outside this phase folder.

## 9. Examples

### Example A: Staleness-checking finding

`src/drift/checkers/staleness.ts` does not rely on human judgment alone; it flags scaffold files by both elapsed days and commits since last change. A strong finding would explain why combining temporal and repository-activity signals is stronger than date-only freshness, show how that could improve Public's documentation hygiene, and classify the idea as `adopt now`, `prototype later`, or `reject`.

### Example B: Drift-detection composition finding

Mex does not use one monolithic "docs are wrong" check. `path.ts`, `edges.ts`, `index-sync.ts`, `command.ts`, `dependency.ts`, `cross-file.ts`, and `script-coverage.ts` each catch a different failure mode. A strong finding would describe how those checks work together, identify which subset would most improve `Code_Environment/Public`, and explain where Spec Kit validation already covers adjacent concerns.

## 10. Constraints

### 10.1 Error handling

- If a README claim cannot be verified in `src/`, mark it as unverified instead of repeating it as fact.
- If a checker behaves differently from the README summary, prefer the source code and call out the discrepancy explicitly.
- If a file path inside the external repo is missing, say so plainly and continue with the remaining evidence rather than guessing.
- If the external repo structure changes from the paths named here, adjust the reading path but preserve the same analytical order.

### 10.2 Scope

**IN SCOPE**

- scaffold structure and navigation model
- markdown persistence design
- all eight drift checkers
- scoring and health reporting
- staleness thresholds and git-based freshness signals
- targeted sync prompt generation
- scaffold auto-growth and pattern creation
- comparison with `Code_Environment/Public` validation and memory surfaces

**OUT OF SCOPE**

- generic Node.js packaging analysis
- benchmarking build performance
- speculative database redesigns not grounded in Mex evidence
- unrelated hybrid-RAG implementation details
- re-litigating memory persistence questions already owned by phase `001`

### 10.3 Prioritization framework

Rank findings in this order: drift-detection value for `Code_Environment/Public`, documentation-to-code synchronization impact, scaffold simplicity-to-maintainability ratio, staleness-signal usefulness, compatibility with existing Spec Kit workflows, implementation cost, and cross-phase differentiation from phases `001`, `003`, and `004`.

## 11. Deliverables

- `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`, and any level-required spec docs present and valid before deep research starts
- `research/research.md` as the canonical report with at least 5 evidence-backed findings
- explicit comparison between Mex and current `Code_Environment/Public` documentation/memory validation capabilities
- findings that classify each recommendation as `adopt now`, `prototype later`, or `reject`
- `implementation-summary.md` created at the end
- memory saved from this phase folder using `generate-context.js`

Minimum finding schema:

- finding title
- exact source evidence
- what Mex does
- why it matters for `Code_Environment/Public`
- recommendation: `adopt now`, `prototype later`, or `reject`
- affected subsystem
- migration risk, false-positive risk, or validation requirement

## 12. Evaluation Criteria

- CLEAR target: `>= 40/50`
- RICCE compliance is visible in the prompt:
  - **Role** is specialized in scaffold architecture, drift detection, markdown persistence, and synchronization
  - **Instructions** are ordered, concrete, and path-specific
  - **Context** is domain-specific and cross-phase aware
  - **Constraints** clearly limit scope and error handling
  - **Examples** show what strong Mex findings look like
- at least 5 findings are evidence-backed rather than speculative
- findings analyze both the benefits and limitations of markdown-first persistence
- findings compare Mex's static drift detection against existing `validate.sh` behavior rather than treating them as interchangeable
- overlap with phase `001` is explicitly resolved so this phase stays focused on drift detection and scaffold design

- **Source**: [README.md](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/README.md#L72), [claims.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/src/drift/claims.ts#L48), [drift/index.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/src/drift/index.ts#L17), [path.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/src/drift/checkers/path.ts#L8), [edges.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/src/drift/checkers/edges.ts#L5), [index-sync.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/src/drift/checkers/index-sync.ts#L6)
- **What it does**: Mex extracts typed markdown claims from inline code, code blocks, and dependency headings, then runs zero-token checks for missing paths, dead frontmatter edges, and `patterns/INDEX.md` drift. It already distinguishes real missing references from pattern/template placeholders by downgrading some path misses to warnings.
- **Why it matters for us**: This cleanly maps to our real gap. Spec Kit already has semantic retrieval, trigger recall, causal links, and health tooling, but it does not statically verify that markdown references still point to real files or that pattern indexes stay in sync.

- **What it does**: Mex extracts typed markdown claims from inline code, code blocks, and dependency headings, then runs zero-token checks for missing paths, dead frontmatter edges, and `patterns/INDEX.md` drift. It already distinguishes real missing references from pattern/template placeholders by downgrading some path misses to warnings.
- **Why it matters for us**: This cleanly maps to our real gap. Spec Kit already has semantic retrieval, trigger recall, causal links, and health tooling, but it does not statically verify that markdown references still point to real files or that pattern indexes stay in sync.
- **Recommendation**: adopt now
- **Impact**: high

- **Why it matters**: The common pattern is not “show one health number.” It is “surface whether the answer is trustworthy, partial, or unavailable.” That aligns directly with Public’s existing trust model.
- **Recommendation**: adopt now
- **Impact**: high

### Finding 4: Scope and mutation authority must stay governed even when ergonomics improve
- **Source**: [iteration-005.md](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/001-engram-main/research/iterations/iteration-005.md), [research.md](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/004-opencode-mnemosyne-main/research/research.md), [iteration-018.md](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/005-mempalace/research/iterations/iteration-018.md), [memory-context.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/handlers/memory-context.ts), [memory-triggers.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/handlers/memory-triggers.ts)
- **What it does**: Engram’s lifecycle and topic boundaries, Mnemosyne’s project/global split, MemPalace’s separate fact plane, and Modus’s failure modes all reinforce the same rule: convenience surfaces are acceptable only when they compile down to a trusted scope and audited mutation model.
- **Why it matters**: Public is already closer to the right default here than any external system in this set. The safe direction is ergonomic aliases over existing authority, not cheaper write paths or weaker identity rules.
- **Recommendation**: reject
- **Impact**: high

### Finding 5: Mex is uniquely valuable because it checks documentation truth against the filesystem, not because it stores memory better
- **Source**: [iteration-020.md](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/research/iterations/iteration-020.md)
- **What it does**: Mex’s standout mechanism is typed markdown claim extraction plus zero-token path, edge, index, and freshness checking. None of the other four phases contributed a comparably strong docs-to-code integrity layer.
- **Why it matters**: This is the one area where Mex adds genuinely new capability to Public rather than overlapping with retrieval, session recovery, or local-memory ergonomics we already have.
- **Recommendation**: adopt now
- **Impact**: high

### Finding 6: Mex’s repair-brief loop is also unique, but its auto-growth and score-centric habits are the wrong transplant
- **Source**: [iteration-020.md](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/research/iterations/iteration-020.md)
- **What it does**: `mex sync` turns failed drift checks into bounded repair briefs with local file context and recent diffs, while `pattern add`, scaffold GROW defaults, and the single drift score push partially trusted content and compressed health reporting too early.
- **Why it matters**: The repair loop fits Public’s packet-local remediation style very well. The auto-growth and score-first pieces cut directly against Public’s trust-sensitive memory model.
- **Recommendation**: NEW FEATURE
- **Impact**: medium

## Assessment
- New information ratio: 0.43

## Recommended Next Focus
Spec one Public-native “memory integrity and continuity facade” packet with four bounded slices: 1. packet-local markdown path/edge/index drift checks, 2. compaction-time memory action card, 3. thin lifecycle/doctor aliases over existing MCP authority, 4. provider-neutral repair briefs generated from failed integrity checks.

RESEARCH BRIEF:
# $refine TIDD-EC Prompt: 002-mex-main

## 2. Role

You are a research specialist in knowledge scaffold architectures, drift detection systems, markdown-based persistence, and codebase-knowledge synchronization. Work like a systems analyst who can separate scaffold design, static drift checking, and targeted AI repair loops, then translate Mex's concrete mechanisms into practical improvements for `Code_Environment/Public`.

## 3. Task

Research Mex's markdown scaffold and drift detection patterns to identify practical, evidence-backed improvements for `Code_Environment/Public`, especially around staleness detection, codebase-knowledge synchronization, and structured project knowledge. Determine which Mex patterns should be `adopt now`, `prototype later`, or `reject`.

## 4. Context

### 4.1 System Description

Mex is a structured markdown scaffold with a TypeScript/Node.js CLI for persistent AI project memory. Instead of a database, it keeps project knowledge in navigable markdown files such as `AGENTS.md`, `ROUTER.md`, `context/*.md`, and `patterns/*.md`. Its defining mechanism is drift detection: eight static checkers validate scaffold claims against the real codebase without AI or token spend. Those checkers cover path validation, frontmatter edges, pattern index consistency, staleness based on git history, command existence, dependency claims, cross-file contradictions, and script coverage. Drift starts at score `100` and deducts `-10` per error, `-3` per warning, and `-1` per info. The scaffold is designed to grow after real work through pattern creation, targeted context updates, and current-state refreshes rather than one-time setup alone.

### 4.2 Cross-Phase Awareness Table

| Phase | System | Core Pattern | Overlap Risk | Differentiation |
|-------|--------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|
| 001 | Engram | MCP memory server (Go, SQLite+FTS5) | 002 (memory persistence) | Focus tool profiles, session lifecycle, topic keys |
| 002 | Mex | Markdown scaffold + drift detection | 001 (memory), 003 (memory) | Focus drift detection, scaffold structure, no-DB approach |
| 003 | Modus Memory | FSRS spaced repetition + BM25 | 001 (FTS5), 004 (local memory) | Focus FSRS decay, cross-referencing, librarian expansion |
| 004 | OpenCode Mnemosyne | Hybrid search (FTS5 + vector) | 001 (FTS5), 003 (local memory) | Focus vector search, plugin architecture, scoping |

### 4.3 What This Repo Already Has

`Code_Environment/Public` already has Spec Kit validation via `validate.sh` with severity-oriented checks, indexed memory files with frontmatter, and a `MEMORY.md`-style documentation/memory model. What it does **not** currently have is an automated drift checker that compares documentation or memory scaffolds against the actual filesystem, commands, dependencies, git staleness, or cross-file contradictions. Research should stay centered on that gap rather than re-covering general memory persistence already addressed by phase `001`.

## 5. Instructions

1. Treat `/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main` as the pre-approved phase folder. Skip Gate 3, keep all writes inside this phase folder, and treat everything under `external/` as read-only.
2. Start with `external/mex-main/README.md`. Read the positioning, the eight-checker summary, the drift-score model, the command surface, and the documented file structure before inferring anything from implementation details.
3. Immediately after the README, inspect the scaffold contract files in this order: `external/mex-main/AGENTS.md`, `external/mex-main/ROUTER.md`, `external/mex-main/SETUP.md`, and `external/mex-main/SYNC.md`. Treat these as the canonical markdown scaffold, growth loop, and resync workflow.
4. Map the scaffold structure explicitly: project-root tool instruction file, scaffold root, `context/` files, `patterns/INDEX.md`, pattern files, and the GROW step that updates project state and creates new patterns from real work.
5. Read `external/mex-main/src/cli.ts` next. Trace the user-facing layers in order: `mex init`, `mex check`, `mex sync`, `mex pattern add`, `mex watch`, and `mex commands`. Use this to anchor later claims about the relationship between setup, drift detection, targeted sync, and scaffold growth.
6. Read `external/mex-main/src/drift/index.ts`, `src/drift/claims.ts`, `src/drift/frontmatter.ts`, and `src/drift/scoring.ts`. Understand how Mex finds scaffold files, extracts claims from markdown, parses frontmatter edges, runs checker passes, and computes the final drift score.
7. Read `external/mex-main/src/scanner/index.ts` plus the scanner modules it composes. Focus on how Mex builds a structured brief first, then instructs AI to populate scaffold files from that brief rather than from raw exploratory browsing.
8. Read `external/mex-main/src/sync/brief-builder.ts` and `src/pattern/index.ts`. Study how Mex turns drift issues into targeted repair prompts, supplies filesystem and git context, and appends new patterns into the scaffold instead of treating documentation as static.
9. Examine the first three drift checkers individually: `src/drift/checkers/path.ts`, `src/drift/checkers/edges.ts`, and `src/drift/checkers/index-sync.ts`. Document the actual detection logic, severity behavior, placeholder handling, and what kind of documentation drift each checker catches.
10. Examine the next three drift checkers individually: `src/drift/checkers/staleness.ts`, `src/drift/checkers/command.ts`, and `src/drift/checkers/dependency.ts`. Capture the exact thresholds and matching rules, including how staleness uses both days and commit counts, how commands are validated, and how dependency claims are compared to manifests.
11. Examine the final two drift checkers individually: `src/drift/checkers/cross-file.ts` and `src/drift/checkers/script-coverage.ts`. Explain how Mex detects contradictions across scaffold files and how it checks whether real scripts are missing from the scaffold narrative.
12. Compare Mex directly against current `Code_Environment/Public` capabilities: Spec Kit validation, memory frontmatter, documented memory/index structure, and other repo guidance files. Be precise about where Mex adds new capability versus where it overlaps with systems already covered by phases `001`, `003`, or `004`.
13. Before any deep-research run, ensure this phase folder contains the expected spec-kit docs for the chosen level. Validate the phase folder with:
    ```bash
    cd /Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public && bash .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/spec/validate.sh "/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main" --strict
    ```
14. After validation passes, run deep research using this exact topic:
    ```text
    Research the external repository at /Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/mex-main and identify concrete improvements for Code_Environment/Public, especially around knowledge scaffold design, drift detection, staleness checking, codebase-knowledge synchronization, and structured project memory.
    ```
15. Save all outputs inside this phase folder, especially under `research/`. Every finding must cite exact file paths, describe what Mex actually does, why it matters for `Code_Environment/Public`, whether it should be `adopt now`, `prototype later`, or `reject`, what subsystem it would affect, and what migration or validation risk comes with it. When research is complete, update `checklist.md`, create `implementation-summary.md`, and save memory with:
    ```bash
    cd /Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public && node .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/dist/memory/generate-context.js "/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main"
    ```

## 6. Research Questions

1. How does Mex's markdown-first scaffold change the tradeoff between navigability, editability, and correctness compared with database-backed memory systems?
2. How do the eight drift checkers compose into a practical health model, and where are the blind spots between checker coverage and actual scaffold truthfulness?
3. Are Mex's staleness thresholds (`30` warning days, `90` error days, `50` warning commits, `200` error commits) reasonable defaults, and how might similar thresholds be calibrated for `Code_Environment/Public`?
4. What makes Mex's path, edge, and index-sync checks useful as low-cost documentation integrity guards, and which of those ideas translate cleanly into Spec Kit?
5. How effective is the scoring model (`100 - 10/error - 3/warning - 1/info`) as a developer-facing health metric, and would `Code_Environment/Public` benefit from a comparable score or from severity-only reporting?
6. How does Mex's claim extraction model work in practice, especially its distinction between paths, commands, dependencies, and versions pulled from markdown?
7. What does Mex gain by checking real scripts that are undocumented in the scaffold, and how does that differ from existing `validate.sh` checks in this repo?
8. How does Mex's targeted sync flow convert static drift findings into precise AI repair prompts, and could `Code_Environment/Public` adopt a similar "fix only what's broken" pattern?
9. How do Mex's GROW rules and `pattern add` workflow support scaffold auto-growth after tasks rather than only during initialization?
10. What are the strongest arguments for keeping some project knowledge in markdown even when richer search or database systems exist elsewhere in the stack?

## 7. Do's

- Do examine each of the eight drift checkers individually rather than relying on the README summary alone.
- Do study the scoring algorithm and relate score behavior to developer incentives and operational clarity.
- Do analyze how scaffold growth happens after tasks through GROW rules, `pattern add`, targeted sync, and current-state updates.
- Do compare Mex's drift logic directly against `Code_Environment/Public` validation and memory/documentation surfaces.
- Do separate static drift detection from AI-assisted repair; they are distinct layers in Mex.
- Do highlight which Mex ideas help codebase-knowledge synchronization without requiring a database.
- Do address overlap with phase `001` explicitly so this phase stays focused on drift detection and scaffold design rather than generic persistence.

## 8. Don'ts

- Do not focus the research on npm packaging, build tooling, or release mechanics.
- Do not dismiss the markdown approach as primitive; markdown is the core persistence decision under evaluation.
- Do not confuse drift detection with AI-based validation or sync; the checkers are zero-token static analysis.
- Do not let README prose overrule source evidence from `src/`.
- Do not recommend importing Mex wholesale if the reusable value is only a subset of its design.
- Do not collapse this phase into memory-persistence comparisons already owned by phase `001`.
- Do not edit anything under `external/` or outside this phase folder.

## 9. Examples

### Example A: Staleness-checking finding

`src/drift/checkers/staleness.ts` does not rely on human judgment alone; it flags scaffold files by both elapsed days and commits since last change. A strong finding would explain why combining temporal and repository-activity signals is stronger than date-only freshness, show how that could improve Public's documentation hygiene, and classify the idea as `adopt now`, `prototype later`, or `reject`.

### Example B: Drift-detection composition finding

Mex does not use one monolithic "docs are wrong" check. `path.ts`, `edges.ts`, `index-sync.ts`, `command.ts`, `dependency.ts`, `cross-file.ts`, and `script-coverage.ts` each catch a different failure mode. A strong finding would describe how those checks work together, identify which subset would most improve `Code_Environment/Public`, and explain where Spec Kit validation already covers adjacent concerns.

## 10. Constraints

### 10.1 Error handling

- If a README claim cannot be verified in `src/`, mark it as unverified instead of repeating it as fact.
- If a checker behaves differently from the README summary, prefer the source code and call out the discrepancy explicitly.
- If a file path inside the external repo is missing, say so plainly and continue with the remaining evidence rather than guessing.
- If the external repo structure changes from the paths named here, adjust the reading path but preserve the same analytical order.

## Findings
### Finding 1: Static markdown reference integrity is the only clear adopt-now slice
- **Source**: [README.md](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/README.md#L72), [claims.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/src/drift/claims.ts#L48), [drift/index.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/src/drift/index.ts#L17), [path.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/src/drift/checkers/path.ts#L8), [edges.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/src/drift/checkers/edges.ts#L5), [index-sync.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/src/drift/checkers/index-sync.ts#L6)
- **What it does**: Mex extracts typed markdown claims from inline code, code blocks, and dependency headings, then runs zero-token checks for missing paths, dead frontmatter edges, and `patterns/INDEX.md` drift. It already distinguishes real missing references from pattern/template placeholders by downgrading some path misses to warnings.
- **Why it matters for us**: This cleanly maps to our real gap. Spec Kit already has semantic retrieval, trigger recall, causal links, and health tooling, but it does not statically verify that markdown references still point to real files or that pattern indexes stay in sync.
- **Recommendation**: adopt now
- **Impact**: high
--- Iteration 21 ---
- **Function signatures**: `extractReferenceClaims(filePath: string, content: string): ReferenceClaim[]`; `runReferenceIntegrityScan(args: { specFolder: string; projectRoot: string; includeMemoryDocs?: boolean; includeSpecDocs?: boolean }): Promise<ReferenceIntegrityReport>`; `handleMemoryHealth(args: HealthArgs & { reportMode?: 'reference_integrity'; includeWarnings?: boolean }): Promise<MCPResponse>`.
- **Migration steps**: 1. Ship a regex-first v1 extractor for markdown links, backticked file paths, YAML `edges`, and local `INDEX.md` references. 2. Reuse existing placeholder/contamination heuristics from [validate-memory-quality.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/lib/validate-memory-quality.ts) so template examples downgrade to warnings instead of hard errors. 3. Add `memory_health({ reportMode: 'reference_integrity', specFolder })` with severity-first output and no composite score. 4. Gate `validate.sh --strict` on integrity errors only, leaving warning-only drift visible but non-blocking.

### Finding 2: Add a supplemental freshness contract with explicit `exact`, `degraded`, and `unknown` provenance
- **Source**: [staleness.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/src/drift/checkers/staleness.ts), [git.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/src/git.ts), [session-resume.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/handlers/session-resume.ts), [git-context-extractor.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/extractors/git-context-extractor.ts), [post-save-review.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/core/post-save-review.ts)
- **What it does**: Mex uses dual thresholds on days and commits, but silently collapses git failures to `null`. Spec Kit already has a better trust precedent in `session_resume`: freshness is surfaced as an explicit contract, not hidden behind a score. The right transplant is a supplemental signal, not a ranker.
- **Why it matters**: We already persist `headRef`, `commitRef`, `repositoryState`, and reviewer guardrails for missing provenance. That gives us the substrate to expose freshness honestly without pretending every result is equally current.
- **Recommendation**: adopt now
- **Impact**: high
- **Blueprint files**: create `scripts/lib/memory-freshness.ts`; edit [git-context-extractor.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/extractors/git-context-extractor.ts), [workflow.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/core/workflow.ts), [post-save-review.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/core/post-save-review.ts), [session-types.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/types/session-types.ts), [memory-search.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/handlers/memory-search.ts), [memory-context.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/handlers/memory-context.ts), and [memory-crud-health.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/handlers/memory-crud-health.ts).
- **Function signatures**: `computeFreshnessSignal(args: { filePath: string; projectRoot: string; headRef?: string | null; commitRef?: string | null; repositoryState?: string | null }): Promise<FreshnessSignal>`; `type FreshnessSignal = { provenance: 'exact' | 'degraded' | 'unknown'; ageState: 'fresh' | 'warning' | 'stale' | 'unavailable'; daysSinceChange: number | null; commitsSinceChange: number | null; reason?: string }`; `attachFreshnessTrace(result: Record<string, unknown>, freshness: FreshnessSignal): Record<string, unknown>`.
- **Migration steps**: 1. Compute freshness only when saved git provenance exists; otherwise emit `degraded` or `unknown` with a concrete reason. 2. Reuse Mex’s initial thresholds (`30/90` days, `50/200` commits) but expose them as trace metadata, not ranking weights. 3. Add a reviewer rule that flags missing freshness metadata only when provenance was expected. 4. Surface the signal first in `memory_health` and trace/debug paths, then decide later whether default `memory_context` and `memory_search` responses should show it.

### Finding 3: Generate provider-neutral repair briefs from integrity failures instead of launching a sync loop
- **Source**: [brief-builder.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/src/sync/brief-builder.ts), [memory-crud-health.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/handlers/memory-crud-health.ts), [generate-context.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/memory/generate-context.ts), [workflow.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/core/workflow.ts)
- **What it does**: Mex groups issues by file, includes current content, nearby filesystem context, and recent diffs, then emits a bounded repair brief. The reusable part is the brief artifact, not the interactive CLI loop.
- **Why it matters**: This matches Spec Kit’s packet-local remediation style. We need an auditable handoff surface that says “these are the broken references and the likely replacements,” without auto-mutating documentation or introducing a separate operator UX.
- **Recommendation**: adopt now
- **Impact**: medium
- **Blueprint files**: create `mcp_server/lib/reference-integrity/build-repair-brief.ts` and `scripts/spec/generate-repair-brief.ts`; edit [memory-crud-health.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/handlers/memory-crud-health.ts) and [progressive-validate.sh](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/spec/progressive-validate.sh).
- **Function signatures**: `buildIntegrityRepairBrief(args: { specFolder: string; issues: ReferenceIntegrityIssue[]; projectRoot: string; includeGitDiff?: boolean }): Promise<{ markdown: string; targets: IntegrityRepairTarget[] }>`; `type IntegrityRepairTarget = { filePath: string; issues: ReferenceIntegrityIssue[]; nearbyFiles: string[]; recentDiff: string | null }`; `main(argv: string[]): Promise<number>`.
- **Migration steps**: 1. Consume the report schema from Finding 1 and group issues by file. 2. Add bounded context only: current file body, sibling-directory listings, and short recent git diffs. 3. Emit a markdown brief plus JSON payload under `scratch/repair/` inside the target spec folder, rather than editing docs directly. 4. Optionally let `memory_health({ reportMode: 'reference_integrity' })` return a brief preview, but keep the write path explicit and packet-local.

## Assessment
- New information ratio: 0.35

Workspace access was read-only in this session, so I returned the blueprints directly instead of updating the phase-folder research artifacts.

## Recommended Next Focus
Implement Finding 1 first as a narrow `memory_health` plus `validate.sh` slice, then add Finding 2 as trace-only freshness metadata with explicit degraded/unknown semantics, and only then layer Finding 3 on top of the shared issue schema so repair briefs are generated from real integrity findings rather than a parallel analyzer.

RESEARCH BRIEF:
# $refine TIDD-EC Prompt: 002-mex-main

## 2. Role

You are a research specialist in knowledge scaffold architectures, drift detection systems, markdown-based persistence, and codebase-knowledge synchronization. Work like a systems analyst who can separate scaffold design, static drift checking, and targeted AI repair loops, then translate Mex's concrete mechanisms into practical improvements for `Code_Environment/Public`.

## 3. Task

Research Mex's markdown scaffold and drift detection patterns to identify practical, evidence-backed improvements for `Code_Environment/Public`, especially around staleness detection, codebase-knowledge synchronization, and structured project knowledge. Determine which Mex patterns should be `adopt now`, `prototype later`, or `reject`.

## 4. Context

### 4.1 System Description

Mex is a structured markdown scaffold with a TypeScript/Node.js CLI for persistent AI project memory. Instead of a database, it keeps project knowledge in navigable markdown files such as `AGENTS.md`, `ROUTER.md`, `context/*.md`, and `patterns/*.md`. Its defining mechanism is drift detection: eight static checkers validate scaffold claims against the real codebase without AI or token spend. Those checkers cover path validation, frontmatter edges, pattern index consistency, staleness based on git history, command existence, dependency claims, cross-file contradictions, and script coverage. Drift starts at score `100` and deducts `-10` per error, `-3` per warning, and `-1` per info. The scaffold is designed to grow after real work through pattern creation, targeted context updates, and current-state refreshes rather than one-time setup alone.

### 4.2 Cross-Phase Awareness Table

| Phase | System | Core Pattern | Overlap Risk | Differentiation |
|-------|--------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|
| 001 | Engram | MCP memory server (Go, SQLite+FTS5) | 002 (memory persistence) | Focus tool profiles, session lifecycle, topic keys |
| 002 | Mex | Markdown scaffold + drift detection | 001 (memory), 003 (memory) | Focus drift detection, scaffold structure, no-DB approach |
| 003 | Modus Memory | FSRS spaced repetition + BM25 | 001 (FTS5), 004 (local memory) | Focus FSRS decay, cross-referencing, librarian expansion |
| 004 | OpenCode Mnemosyne | Hybrid search (FTS5 + vector) | 001 (FTS5), 003 (local memory) | Focus vector search, plugin architecture, scoping |

### 4.3 What This Repo Already Has

`Code_Environment/Public` already has Spec Kit validation via `validate.sh` with severity-oriented checks, indexed memory files with frontmatter, and a `MEMORY.md`-style documentation/memory model. What it does **not** currently have is an automated drift checker that compares documentation or memory scaffolds against the actual filesystem, commands, dependencies, git staleness, or cross-file contradictions. Research should stay centered on that gap rather than re-covering general memory persistence already addressed by phase `001`.

## 5. Instructions

1. Treat `/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main` as the pre-approved phase folder. Skip Gate 3, keep all writes inside this phase folder, and treat everything under `external/` as read-only.
2. Start with `external/mex-main/README.md`. Read the positioning, the eight-checker summary, the drift-score model, the command surface, and the documented file structure before inferring anything from implementation details.
3. Immediately after the README, inspect the scaffold contract files in this order: `external/mex-main/AGENTS.md`, `external/mex-main/ROUTER.md`, `external/mex-main/SETUP.md`, and `external/mex-main/SYNC.md`. Treat these as the canonical markdown scaffold, growth loop, and resync workflow.
4. Map the scaffold structure explicitly: project-root tool instruction file, scaffold root, `context/` files, `patterns/INDEX.md`, pattern files, and the GROW step that updates project state and creates new patterns from real work.
5. Read `external/mex-main/src/cli.ts` next. Trace the user-facing layers in order: `mex init`, `mex check`, `mex sync`, `mex pattern add`, `mex watch`, and `mex commands`. Use this to anchor later claims about the relationship between setup, drift detection, targeted sync, and scaffold growth.
6. Read `external/mex-main/src/drift/index.ts`, `src/drift/claims.ts`, `src/drift/frontmatter.ts`, and `src/drift/scoring.ts`. Understand how Mex finds scaffold files, extracts claims from markdown, parses frontmatter edges, runs checker passes, and computes the final drift score.
7. Read `external/mex-main/src/scanner/index.ts` plus the scanner modules it composes. Focus on how Mex builds a structured brief first, then instructs AI to populate scaffold files from that brief rather than from raw exploratory browsing.
8. Read `external/mex-main/src/sync/brief-builder.ts` and `src/pattern/index.ts`. Study how Mex turns drift issues into targeted repair prompts, supplies filesystem and git context, and appends new patterns into the scaffold instead of treating documentation as static.
9. Examine the first three drift checkers individually: `src/drift/checkers/path.ts`, `src/drift/checkers/edges.ts`, and `src/drift/checkers/index-sync.ts`. Document the actual detection logic, severity behavior, placeholder handling, and what kind of documentation drift each checker catches.
10. Examine the next three drift checkers individually: `src/drift/checkers/staleness.ts`, `src/drift/checkers/command.ts`, and `src/drift/checkers/dependency.ts`. Capture the exact thresholds and matching rules, including how staleness uses both days and commit counts, how commands are validated, and how dependency claims are compared to manifests.
11. Examine the final two drift checkers individually: `src/drift/checkers/cross-file.ts` and `src/drift/checkers/script-coverage.ts`. Explain how Mex detects contradictions across scaffold files and how it checks whether real scripts are missing from the scaffold narrative.
12. Compare Mex directly against current `Code_Environment/Public` capabilities: Spec Kit validation, memory frontmatter, documented memory/index structure, and other repo guidance files. Be precise about where Mex adds new capability versus where it overlaps with systems already covered by phases `001`, `003`, or `004`.
13. Before any deep-research run, ensure this phase folder contains the expected spec-kit docs for the chosen level. Validate the phase folder with:
    ```bash
    cd /Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public && bash .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/spec/validate.sh "/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main" --strict
    ```
14. After validation passes, run deep research using this exact topic:
    ```text
    Research the external repository at /Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/mex-main and identify concrete improvements for Code_Environment/Public, especially around knowledge scaffold design, drift detection, staleness checking, codebase-knowledge synchronization, and structured project memory.
    ```
15. Save all outputs inside this phase folder, especially under `research/`. Every finding must cite exact file paths, describe what Mex actually does, why it matters for `Code_Environment/Public`, whether it should be `adopt now`, `prototype later`, or `reject`, what subsystem it would affect, and what migration or validation risk comes with it. When research is complete, update `checklist.md`, create `implementation-summary.md`, and save memory with:
    ```bash
    cd /Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public && node .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/dist/memory/generate-context.js "/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main"
    ```

## 6. Research Questions

1. How does Mex's markdown-first scaffold change the tradeoff between navigability, editability, and correctness compared with database-backed memory systems?
2. How do the eight drift checkers compose into a practical health model, and where are the blind spots between checker coverage and actual scaffold truthfulness?
3. Are Mex's staleness thresholds (`30` warning days, `90` error days, `50` warning commits, `200` error commits) reasonable defaults, and how might similar thresholds be calibrated for `Code_Environment/Public`?
4. What makes Mex's path, edge, and index-sync checks useful as low-cost documentation integrity guards, and which of those ideas translate cleanly into Spec Kit?
5. How effective is the scoring model (`100 - 10/error - 3/warning - 1/info`) as a developer-facing health metric, and would `Code_Environment/Public` benefit from a comparable score or from severity-only reporting?
6. How does Mex's claim extraction model work in practice, especially its distinction between paths, commands, dependencies, and versions pulled from markdown?
7. What does Mex gain by checking real scripts that are undocumented in the scaffold, and how does that differ from existing `validate.sh` checks in this repo?
8. How does Mex's targeted sync flow convert static drift findings into precise AI repair prompts, and could `Code_Environment/Public` adopt a similar "fix only what's broken" pattern?
9. How do Mex's GROW rules and `pattern add` workflow support scaffold auto-growth after tasks rather than only during initialization?
10. What are the strongest arguments for keeping some project knowledge in markdown even when richer search or database systems exist elsewhere in the stack?

## 7. Do's

- Do examine each of the eight drift checkers individually rather than relying on the README summary alone.
- Do study the scoring algorithm and relate score behavior to developer incentives and operational clarity.
- Do analyze how scaffold growth happens after tasks through GROW rules, `pattern add`, targeted sync, and current-state updates.
- Do compare Mex's drift logic directly against `Code_Environment/Public` validation and memory/documentation surfaces.
- Do separate static drift detection from AI-assisted repair; they are distinct layers in Mex.
- Do highlight which Mex ideas help codebase-knowledge synchronization without requiring a database.
- Do address overlap with phase `001` explicitly so this phase stays focused on drift detection and scaffold design rather than generic persistence.

## 8. Don'ts

- Do not focus the research on npm packaging, build tooling, or release mechanics.
- Do not dismiss the markdown approach as primitive; markdown is the core persistence decision under evaluation.
- Do not confuse drift detection with AI-based validation or sync; the checkers are zero-token static analysis.
- Do not let README prose overrule source evidence from `src/`.
- Do not recommend importing Mex wholesale if the reusable value is only a subset of its design.
- Do not collapse this phase into memory-persistence comparisons already owned by phase `001`.
- Do not edit anything under `external/` or outside this phase folder.

## 9. Examples

### Example A: Staleness-checking finding

`src/drift/checkers/staleness.ts` does not rely on human judgment alone; it flags scaffold files by both elapsed days and commits since last change. A strong finding would explain why combining temporal and repository-activity signals is stronger than date-only freshness, show how that could improve Public's documentation hygiene, and classify the idea as `adopt now`, `prototype later`, or `reject`.

### Example B: Drift-detection composition finding

Mex does not use one monolithic "docs are wrong" check. `path.ts`, `edges.ts`, `index-sync.ts`, `command.ts`, `dependency.ts`, `cross-file.ts`, and `script-coverage.ts` each catch a different failure mode. A strong finding would describe how those checks work together, identify which subset would most improve `Code_Environment/Public`, and explain where Spec Kit validation already covers adjacent concerns.

## 10. Constraints

### 10.1 Error handling

- If a README claim cannot be verified in `src/`, mark it as unverified instead of repeating it as fact.
- If a checker behaves differently from the README summary, prefer the source code and call out the discrepancy explicitly.
- If a file path inside the external repo is missing, say so plainly and continue with the remaining evidence rather than guessing.
- If the external repo structure changes from the paths named here, adjust the reading path but preserve the same analytical order.

### 10.2 Scope

**IN SCOPE**

- scaffold structure and navigation model
- markdown persistence design
- all eight drift checkers
- scoring and health reporting
- staleness thresholds and git-based freshness signals
- targeted sync prompt generation
- scaffold auto-growth and pattern creation
- comparison with `Code_Environment/Public` validation and memory surfaces

**OUT OF SCOPE**

- generic Node.js packaging analysis
- benchmarking build performance
- speculative database redesigns not grounded in Mex evidence
- unrelated hybrid-RAG implementation details
- re-litigating memory persistence questions already owned by phase `001`

### 10.3 Prioritization framework

Rank findings in this order: drift-detection value for `Code_Environment/Public`, documentation-to-code synchronization impact, scaffold simplicity-to-maintainability ratio, staleness-signal usefulness, compatibility with existing Spec Kit workflows, implementation cost, and cross-phase differentiation from phases `001`, `003`, and `004`.

## 11. Deliverables

- `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`, and any level-required spec docs present and valid before deep research starts
- `research/research.md` as the canonical report with at least 5 evidence-backed findings
- explicit comparison between Mex and current `Code_Environment/Public` documentation/memory validation capabilities
- findings that classify each recommendation as `adopt now`, `prototype later`, or `reject`
- `implementation-summary.md` created at the end
- memory saved from this phase folder using `generate-context.js`

Minimum finding schema:

- finding title
- exact source evidence
- what Mex does
- why it matters for `Code_Environment/Public`
- recommendation: `adopt now`, `prototype later`, or `reject`
- affected subsystem
- migration risk, false-positive risk, or validation requirement

### Finding 3: Generate provider-neutral repair briefs from integrity failures instead of launching a sync loop

- **What it does**: Mex groups issues by file, includes current content, nearby filesystem context, and recent diffs, then emits a bounded repair brief. The reusable part is the brief artifact, not the interactive CLI loop.
- **Why it matters**: This matches Spec Kit’s packet-local remediation style. We need an auditable handoff surface that says “these are the broken references and the likely replacements,” without auto-mutating documentation or introducing a separate operator UX.
- **Recommendation**: adopt now

- **Migration steps**: 1. Consume the report schema from Finding 1 and group issues by file. 2. Add bounded context only: current file body, sibling-directory listings, and short recent git diffs. 3.

## Findings
### Finding 1: Static markdown reference integrity is the only clear adopt-now slice
- **Source**: [README.md](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/README.md#L72), [claims.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/src/drift/claims.ts#L48), [drift/index.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/src/drift/index.ts#L17), [path.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/src/drift/checkers/path.ts#L8), [edges.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/src/drift/checkers/edges.ts#L5), [index-sync.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/src/drift/checkers/index-sync.ts#L6)
- **What it does**: Mex extracts typed markdown claims from inline code, code blocks, and dependency headings, then runs zero-token checks for missing paths, dead frontmatter edges, and `patterns/INDEX.md` drift. It already distinguishes real missing references from pattern/template placeholders by downgrading some path misses to warnings.
- **Why it matters for us**: This cleanly maps to our real gap. Spec Kit already has semantic retrieval, trigger recall, causal links, and health tooling, but it does not statically verify that markdown references still point to real files or that pattern indexes stay in sync.
- **Recommendation**: adopt now
- **Impact**: high
--- Iteration 21 ---
- **Why it matters**: For long-lived memory systems, freshness should be separate from relevance. The right transplant is a visible freshness contract like `exact`, `degraded`, `unknown`, not a hidden rank penalty and not silent omission on git failure.
- **Recommendation**: adopt now
- **Impact**: high

### Finding 3: Mex turns stale knowledge into repair briefs instead of automatic rewriting
- **Source**: [brief-builder.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/src/sync/brief-builder.ts#L7), [git.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/src/git.ts#L52), [sync/index.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/src/sync/index.ts#L144)
- **What it does**: When drift is detected, Mex builds bounded repair context from the current file body, issue list, nearby filesystem contents, and recent `HEAD~5` diffs for referenced paths. The temporal signal becomes a repair trigger, not a retrieval weight.
- **Why it matters**: For persistent memory, stale items should trigger verification or repair workflows before they regain authority. “Repair before trust” is more defensible than merely decaying an outdated memory’s score.
- **Recommendation**: prototype later
- **Impact**: medium

### Finding 4: Mex’s continuity strategy is maintenance cadence, not retention policy
- **Source**: [ROUTER.md](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/ROUTER.md#L58), [AGENTS.md](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/AGENTS.md#L27), [pattern/index.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/src/pattern/index.ts#L19), [watch.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/src/watch.ts#L15)
- **What it does**: Mex relies on the GROW loop after each task plus post-commit drift checks to keep the scaffold current. New patterns are stamped with `last_updated`, but there is no deeper lifecycle beyond “update it when real work proves it changed.”
- **Why it matters**: This is a good temporal strategy for low-volume, human-readable scaffolds. It is not enough for a dense memory store where recall, hiding, strengthening, and archival need their own rules.
- **Recommendation**: adopt now
- **Impact**: medium

### Finding 5: Spec Kit already has the multi-layer temporal model Mex lacks, so the gap is freshness provenance rather than decay
- **Source**: [fsrs-scheduler.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/lib/cognitive/fsrs-scheduler.ts#L8), [working-memory.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/lib/cognitive/working-memory.ts#L5), [tier-classifier.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/lib/cognitive/tier-classifier.ts#L37), [archival-manager.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/lib/cognitive/archival-manager.ts#L192), [composite-scoring.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/lib/scoring/composite-scoring.ts#L299), [memory-context.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/handlers/memory-context.ts#L783), [stage2-fusion.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/lib/search/pipeline/stage2-fusion.ts#L840)
- **What it does**: Spec Kit already separates time into four lanes: FSRS long-term retrievability, session-scoped working-memory decay, HOT/WARM/COLD/DORMANT/ARCHIVED state transitions, and background archival for old low-value memories. It even disables decay for resume flows and makes FSRS strengthening opt-in with `trackAccess`.
- **Why it matters**: The main missing piece is not forgetting. It is an honest freshness layer for file-backed knowledge and saved memories. Mex is useful as a freshness/check-and-repair overlay, not as a replacement for Spec Kit’s temporal engine.
- **Recommendation**: adopt now
- **Impact**: high

## Assessment
- New information ratio: 0.30

## Recommended Next Focus
Compare this freshness-only Mex model against Phase 003’s true FSRS-style memory lifecycle, then spec one Public-native temporal contract with four separate lanes: `freshness provenance`, `retrieval decay`, `session attention decay`, and `archival or repair`. That will keep us from collapsing “old,” “irrelevant,” and “possibly wrong” into one score.

RESEARCH BRIEF:
# $refine TIDD-EC Prompt: 002-mex-main

## 2. Role

You are a research specialist in knowledge scaffold architectures, drift detection systems, markdown-based persistence, and codebase-knowledge synchronization. Work like a systems analyst who can separate scaffold design, static drift checking, and targeted AI repair loops, then translate Mex's concrete mechanisms into practical improvements for `Code_Environment/Public`.

## 3. Task

Research Mex's markdown scaffold and drift detection patterns to identify practical, evidence-backed improvements for `Code_Environment/Public`, especially around staleness detection, codebase-knowledge synchronization, and structured project knowledge. Determine which Mex patterns should be `adopt now`, `prototype later`, or `reject`.

## 4. Context

### 4.1 System Description

Mex is a structured markdown scaffold with a TypeScript/Node.js CLI for persistent AI project memory. Instead of a database, it keeps project knowledge in navigable markdown files such as `AGENTS.md`, `ROUTER.md`, `context/*.md`, and `patterns/*.md`. Its defining mechanism is drift detection: eight static checkers validate scaffold claims against the real codebase without AI or token spend. Those checkers cover path validation, frontmatter edges, pattern index consistency, staleness based on git history, command existence, dependency claims, cross-file contradictions, and script coverage. Drift starts at score `100` and deducts `-10` per error, `-3` per warning, and `-1` per info. The scaffold is designed to grow after real work through pattern creation, targeted context updates, and current-state refreshes rather than one-time setup alone.

### 4.2 Cross-Phase Awareness Table

| Phase | System | Core Pattern | Overlap Risk | Differentiation |
|-------|--------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|
| 001 | Engram | MCP memory server (Go, SQLite+FTS5) | 002 (memory persistence) | Focus tool profiles, session lifecycle, topic keys |
| 002 | Mex | Markdown scaffold + drift detection | 001 (memory), 003 (memory) | Focus drift detection, scaffold structure, no-DB approach |
| 003 | Modus Memory | FSRS spaced repetition + BM25 | 001 (FTS5), 004 (local memory) | Focus FSRS decay, cross-referencing, librarian expansion |
| 004 | OpenCode Mnemosyne | Hybrid search (FTS5 + vector) | 001 (FTS5), 003 (local memory) | Focus vector search, plugin architecture, scoping |

### 4.3 What This Repo Already Has

`Code_Environment/Public` already has Spec Kit validation via `validate.sh` with severity-oriented checks, indexed memory files with frontmatter, and a `MEMORY.md`-style documentation/memory model. What it does **not** currently have is an automated drift checker that compares documentation or memory scaffolds against the actual filesystem, commands, dependencies, git staleness, or cross-file contradictions. Research should stay centered on that gap rather than re-covering general memory persistence already addressed by phase `001`.

## 5. Instructions

1. Treat `/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main` as the pre-approved phase folder. Skip Gate 3, keep all writes inside this phase folder, and treat everything under `external/` as read-only.
2. Start with `external/mex-main/README.md`. Read the positioning, the eight-checker summary, the drift-score model, the command surface, and the documented file structure before inferring anything from implementation details.
3. Immediately after the README, inspect the scaffold contract files in this order: `external/mex-main/AGENTS.md`, `external/mex-main/ROUTER.md`, `external/mex-main/SETUP.md`, and `external/mex-main/SYNC.md`. Treat these as the canonical markdown scaffold, growth loop, and resync workflow.
4. Map the scaffold structure explicitly: project-root tool instruction file, scaffold root, `context/` files, `patterns/INDEX.md`, pattern files, and the GROW step that updates project state and creates new patterns from real work.
5. Read `external/mex-main/src/cli.ts` next. Trace the user-facing layers in order: `mex init`, `mex check`, `mex sync`, `mex pattern add`, `mex watch`, and `mex commands`. Use this to anchor later claims about the relationship between setup, drift detection, targeted sync, and scaffold growth.
6. Read `external/mex-main/src/drift/index.ts`, `src/drift/claims.ts`, `src/drift/frontmatter.ts`, and `src/drift/scoring.ts`. Understand how Mex finds scaffold files, extracts claims from markdown, parses frontmatter edges, runs checker passes, and computes the final drift score.
7. Read `external/mex-main/src/scanner/index.ts` plus the scanner modules it composes. Focus on how Mex builds a structured brief first, then instructs AI to populate scaffold files from that brief rather than from raw exploratory browsing.
8. Read `external/mex-main/src/sync/brief-builder.ts` and `src/pattern/index.ts`. Study how Mex turns drift issues into targeted repair prompts, supplies filesystem and git context, and appends new patterns into the scaffold instead of treating documentation as static.
9. Examine the first three drift checkers individually: `src/drift/checkers/path.ts`, `src/drift/checkers/edges.ts`, and `src/drift/checkers/index-sync.ts`. Document the actual detection logic, severity behavior, placeholder handling, and what kind of documentation drift each checker catches.
10. Examine the next three drift checkers individually: `src/drift/checkers/staleness.ts`, `src/drift/checkers/command.ts`, and `src/drift/checkers/dependency.ts`. Capture the exact thresholds and matching rules, including how staleness uses both days and commit counts, how commands are validated, and how dependency claims are compared to manifests.
11. Examine the final two drift checkers individually: `src/drift/checkers/cross-file.ts` and `src/drift/checkers/script-coverage.ts`. Explain how Mex detects contradictions across scaffold files and how it checks whether real scripts are missing from the scaffold narrative.
12. Compare Mex directly against current `Code_Environment/Public` capabilities: Spec Kit validation, memory frontmatter, documented memory/index structure, and other repo guidance files. Be precise about where Mex adds new capability versus where it overlaps with systems already covered by phases `001`, `003`, or `004`.
13. Before any deep-research run, ensure this phase folder contains the expected spec-kit docs for the chosen level. Validate the phase folder with:
    ```bash
    cd /Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public && bash .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/spec/validate.sh "/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main" --strict
    ```
14. After validation passes, run deep research using this exact topic:
    ```text
    Research the external repository at /Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/mex-main and identify concrete improvements for Code_Environment/Public, especially around knowledge scaffold design, drift detection, staleness checking, codebase-knowledge synchronization, and structured project memory.
    ```
15. Save all outputs inside this phase folder, especially under `research/`. Every finding must cite exact file paths, describe what Mex actually does, why it matters for `Code_Environment/Public`, whether it should be `adopt now`, `prototype later`, or `reject`, what subsystem it would affect, and what migration or validation risk comes with it. When research is complete, update `checklist.md`, create `implementation-summary.md`, and save memory with:
    ```bash
    cd /Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public && node .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/dist/memory/generate-context.js "/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main"
    ```

## 6. Research Questions

1. How does Mex's markdown-first scaffold change the tradeoff between navigability, editability, and correctness compared with database-backed memory systems?
2. How do the eight drift checkers compose into a practical health model, and where are the blind spots between checker coverage and actual scaffold truthfulness?
3. Are Mex's staleness thresholds (`30` warning days, `90` error days, `50` warning commits, `200` error commits) reasonable defaults, and how might similar thresholds be calibrated for `Code_Environment/Public`?
4. What makes Mex's path, edge, and index-sync checks useful as low-cost documentation integrity guards, and which of those ideas translate cleanly into Spec Kit?
5. How effective is the scoring model (`100 - 10/error - 3/warning - 1/info`) as a developer-facing health metric, and would `Code_Environment/Public` benefit from a comparable score or from severity-only reporting?
6. How does Mex's claim extraction model work in practice, especially its distinction between paths, commands, dependencies, and versions pulled from markdown?
7. What does Mex gain by checking real scripts that are undocumented in the scaffold, and how does that differ from existing `validate.sh` checks in this repo?
8. How does Mex's targeted sync flow convert static drift findings into precise AI repair prompts, and could `Code_Environment/Public` adopt a similar "fix only what's broken" pattern?
9. How do Mex's GROW rules and `pattern add` workflow support scaffold auto-growth after tasks rather than only during initialization?
10. What are the strongest arguments for keeping some project knowledge in markdown even when richer search or database systems exist elsewhere in the stack?

## 7. Do's

- Do examine each of the eight drift checkers individually rather than relying on the README summary alone.
- Do study the scoring algorithm and relate score behavior to developer incentives and operational clarity.
- Do analyze how scaffold growth happens after tasks through GROW rules, `pattern add`, targeted sync, and current-state updates.
- Do compare Mex's drift logic directly against `Code_Environment/Public` validation and memory/documentation surfaces.
- Do separate static drift detection from AI-assisted repair; they are distinct layers in Mex.
- Do highlight which Mex ideas help codebase-knowledge synchronization without requiring a database.
- Do address overlap with phase `001` explicitly so this phase stays focused on drift detection and scaffold design rather than generic persistence.

## 8. Don'ts

- Do not focus the research on npm packaging, build tooling, or release mechanics.
- Do not dismiss the markdown approach as primitive; markdown is the core persistence decision under evaluation.
- Do not confuse drift detection with AI-based validation or sync; the checkers are zero-token static analysis.
- Do not let README prose overrule source evidence from `src/`.
- Do not recommend importing Mex wholesale if the reusable value is only a subset of its design.
- Do not collapse this phase into memory-persistence comparisons already owned by phase `001`.
- Do not edit anything under `external/` or outside this phase folder.

## 9. Examples

### Example A: Staleness-checking finding

`src/drift/checkers/staleness.ts` does not rely on human judgment alone; it flags scaffold files by both elapsed days and commits since last change. A strong finding would explain why combining temporal and repository-activity signals is stronger than date-only freshness, show how that could improve Public's documentation hygiene, and classify the idea as `adopt now`, `prototype later`, or `reject`.

### Example B: Drift-detection composition finding

Mex does not use one monolithic "docs are wrong" check. `path.ts`, `edges.ts`, `index-sync.ts`, `command.ts`, `dependency.ts`, `cross-file.ts`, and `script-coverage.ts` each catch a different failure mode. A strong finding would describe how those checks work together, identify which subset would most improve `Code_Environment/Public`, and explain where Spec Kit validation already covers adjacent concerns.

## 10. Constraints

### 10.1 Error handling

- If a README claim cannot be verified in `src/`, mark it as unverified instead of repeating it as fact.
- If a checker behaves differently from the README summary, prefer the source code and call out the discrepancy explicitly.
- If a file path inside the external repo is missing, say so plainly and continue with the remaining evidence rather than guessing.
- If the external repo structure changes from the paths named here, adjust the reading path but preserve the same analytical order.

### 10.2 Scope

**IN SCOPE**

- scaffold structure and navigation model
- markdown persistence design
- all eight drift checkers
- scoring and health reporting
- staleness thresholds and git-based freshness signals
- targeted sync prompt generation
- scaffold auto-growth and pattern creation
- comparison with `Code_Environment/Public` validation and memory surfaces

**OUT OF SCOPE**

- generic Node.js packaging analysis
- benchmarking build performance
- speculative database redesigns not grounded in Mex evidence
- unrelated hybrid-RAG implementation details
- re-litigating memory persistence questions already owned by phase `001`

### 10.3 Prioritization framework

Rank findings in this order: drift-detection value for `Code_Environment/Public`, documentation-to-code synchronization impact, scaffold simplicity-to-maintainability ratio, staleness-signal usefulness, compatibility with existing Spec Kit workflows, implementation cost, and cross-phase differentiation from phases `001`, `003`, and `004`.

## 11. Deliverables

- `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`, and any level-required spec docs present and valid before deep research starts
- `research/research.md` as the canonical report with at least 5 evidence-backed findings
- explicit comparison between Mex and current `Code_Environment/Public` documentation/memory validation capabilities
- findings that classify each recommendation as `adopt now`, `prototype later`, or `reject`
- `implementation-summary.md` created at the end

## Assessment
- New information ratio: 0.35

Workspace access was read-only in this session, so I returned the blueprints directly instead of updating the phase-folder research artifacts.

## Recommended Next Focus
Implement Finding 1 first as a narrow `memory_health` plus `validate.sh` slice, then add Finding 2 as trace-only freshness metadata with explicit degraded/unknown semantics, and only then layer Finding 3 on top of the shared issue schema so repair briefs are generated from real integrity findings rather than a parallel analyzer.

## Findings
### Finding 1: Static markdown reference integrity is the only clear adopt-now slice
- **Source**: [README.md](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/README.md#L72), [claims.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/src/drift/claims.ts#L48), [drift/index.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/src/drift/index.ts#L17), [path.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/src/drift/checkers/path.ts#L8), [edges.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/src/drift/checkers/edges.ts#L5), [index-sync.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/src/drift/checkers/index-sync.ts#L6)
- **What it does**: Mex extracts typed markdown claims from inline code, code blocks, and dependency headings, then runs zero-token checks for missing paths, dead frontmatter edges, and `patterns/INDEX.md` drift. It already distinguishes real missing references from pattern/template placeholders by downgrading some path misses to warnings.
- **Why it matters for us**: This cleanly maps to our real gap. Spec Kit already has semantic retrieval, trigger recall, causal links, and health tooling, but it does not statically verify that markdown references still point to real files or that pattern indexes stay in sync.
- **Recommendation**: adopt now
- **Impact**: high
--- Iteration 21 ---
- **Why it matters**: For long-lived memory systems, freshness should be separate from relevance. The right transplant is a visible freshness contract like `exact`, `degraded`, `unknown`, not a hidden rank penalty and not silent omission on git failure.
- **Recommendation**: adopt now
- **Impact**: high

### Finding 3: Mex turns stale knowledge into repair briefs instead of automatic rewriting
- **Source**: [brief-builder.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/src/sync/brief-builder.ts#L7), [git.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/src/git.ts#L52), [sync/index.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/src/sync/index.ts#L144)
- **What it does**: When drift is detected, Mex builds bounded repair context from the current file body, issue list, nearby filesystem contents, and recent `HEAD~5` diffs for referenced paths. The temporal signal becomes a repair trigger, not a retrieval weight.
- **Why it matters**: For persistent memory, stale items should trigger verification or repair workflows before they regain authority. “Repair before trust” is more defensible than merely decaying an outdated memory’s score.
- **Recommendation**: prototype later
- **Impact**: medium

### Finding 4: Mex’s continuity strategy is maintenance cadence, not retention policy
- **Source**: [ROUTER.md](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/ROUTER.md#L58), [AGENTS.md](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/AGENTS.md#L27), [pattern/index.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/src/pattern/index.ts#L19), [watch.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/src/watch.ts#L15)
- **What it does**: Mex relies on the GROW loop after each task plus post-commit drift checks to keep the scaffold current. New patterns are stamped with `last_updated`, but there is no deeper lifecycle beyond “update it when real work proves it changed.”
- **Why it matters**: This is a good temporal strategy for low-volume, human-readable scaffolds. It is not enough for a dense memory store where recall, hiding, strengthening, and archival need their own rules.
- **Recommendation**: adopt now
- **Impact**: medium

### Finding 5: Spec Kit already has the multi-layer temporal model Mex lacks, so the gap is freshness provenance rather than decay
- **Source**: [fsrs-scheduler.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/lib/cognitive/fsrs-scheduler.ts#L8), [working-memory.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/lib/cognitive/working-memory.ts#L5), [tier-classifier.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/lib/cognitive/tier-classifier.ts#L37), [archival-manager.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/lib/cognitive/archival-manager.ts#L192), [composite-scoring.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/lib/scoring/composite-scoring.ts#L299), [memory-context.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/handlers/memory-context.ts#L783), [stage2-fusion.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/lib/search/pipeline/stage2-fusion.ts#L840)
- **What it does**: Spec Kit already separates time into four lanes: FSRS long-term retrievability, session-scoped working-memory decay, HOT/WARM/COLD/DORMANT/ARCHIVED state transitions, and background archival for old low-value memories. It even disables decay for resume flows and makes FSRS strengthening opt-in with `trackAccess`.
- **Why it matters**: The main missing piece is not forgetting. It is an honest freshness layer for file-backed knowledge and saved memories. Mex is useful as a freshness/check-and-repair overlay, not as a replacement for Spec Kit’s temporal engine.
- **Recommendation**: adopt now
- **Impact**: high

## Assessment
- New information ratio: 0.30

## Recommended Next Focus
Compare this freshness-only Mex model against Phase 003’s true FSRS-style memory lifecycle, then spec one Public-native temporal contract with four separate lanes: `freshness provenance`, `retrieval decay`, `session attention decay`, and `archival or repair`. That will keep us from collapsing “old,” “irrelevant,” and “possibly wrong” into one score.

RESEARCH BRIEF:
# $refine TIDD-EC Prompt: 002-mex-main

## 2. Role

You are a research specialist in knowledge scaffold architectures, drift detection systems, markdown-based persistence, and codebase-knowledge synchronization. Work like a systems analyst who can separate scaffold design, static drift checking, and targeted AI repair loops, then translate Mex's concrete mechanisms into practical improvements for `Code_Environment/Public`.

## 3. Task

Research Mex's markdown scaffold and drift detection patterns to identify practical, evidence-backed improvements for `Code_Environment/Public`, especially around staleness detection, codebase-knowledge synchronization, and structured project knowledge. Determine which Mex patterns should be `adopt now`, `prototype later`, or `reject`.

## 4. Context

### 4.1 System Description

Mex is a structured markdown scaffold with a TypeScript/Node.js CLI for persistent AI project memory. Instead of a database, it keeps project knowledge in navigable markdown files such as `AGENTS.md`, `ROUTER.md`, `context/*.md`, and `patterns/*.md`. Its defining mechanism is drift detection: eight static checkers validate scaffold claims against the real codebase without AI or token spend. Those checkers cover path validation, frontmatter edges, pattern index consistency, staleness based on git history, command existence, dependency claims, cross-file contradictions, and script coverage. Drift starts at score `100` and deducts `-10` per error, `-3` per warning, and `-1` per info. The scaffold is designed to grow after real work through pattern creation, targeted context updates, and current-state refreshes rather than one-time setup alone.

### 4.2 Cross-Phase Awareness Table

| Phase | System | Core Pattern | Overlap Risk | Differentiation |
|-------|--------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|
| 001 | Engram | MCP memory server (Go, SQLite+FTS5) | 002 (memory persistence) | Focus tool profiles, session lifecycle, topic keys |
| 002 | Mex | Markdown scaffold + drift detection | 001 (memory), 003 (memory) | Focus drift detection, scaffold structure, no-DB approach |
| 003 | Modus Memory | FSRS spaced repetition + BM25 | 001 (FTS5), 004 (local memory) | Focus FSRS decay, cross-referencing, librarian expansion |
| 004 | OpenCode Mnemosyne | Hybrid search (FTS5 + vector) | 001 (FTS5), 003 (local memory) | Focus vector search, plugin architecture, scoping |

### 4.3 What This Repo Already Has

`Code_Environment/Public` already has Spec Kit validation via `validate.sh` with severity-oriented checks, indexed memory files with frontmatter, and a `MEMORY.md`-style documentation/memory model. What it does **not** currently have is an automated drift checker that compares documentation or memory scaffolds against the actual filesystem, commands, dependencies, git staleness, or cross-file contradictions. Research should stay centered on that gap rather than re-covering general memory persistence already addressed by phase `001`.

## 5. Instructions

1. Treat `/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main` as the pre-approved phase folder. Skip Gate 3, keep all writes inside this phase folder, and treat everything under `external/` as read-only.
2. Start with `external/mex-main/README.md`. Read the positioning, the eight-checker summary, the drift-score model, the command surface, and the documented file structure before inferring anything from implementation details.
3. Immediately after the README, inspect the scaffold contract files in this order: `external/mex-main/AGENTS.md`, `external/mex-main/ROUTER.md`, `external/mex-main/SETUP.md`, and `external/mex-main/SYNC.md`. Treat these as the canonical markdown scaffold, growth loop, and resync workflow.
4. Map the scaffold structure explicitly: project-root tool instruction file, scaffold root, `context/` files, `patterns/INDEX.md`, pattern files, and the GROW step that updates project state and creates new patterns from real work.
5. Read `external/mex-main/src/cli.ts` next. Trace the user-facing layers in order: `mex init`, `mex check`, `mex sync`, `mex pattern add`, `mex watch`, and `mex commands`. Use this to anchor later claims about the relationship between setup, drift detection, targeted sync, and scaffold growth.
6. Read `external/mex-main/src/drift/index.ts`, `src/drift/claims.ts`, `src/drift/frontmatter.ts`, and `src/drift/scoring.ts`. Understand how Mex finds scaffold files, extracts claims from markdown, parses frontmatter edges, runs checker passes, and computes the final drift score.
7. Read `external/mex-main/src/scanner/index.ts` plus the scanner modules it composes. Focus on how Mex builds a structured brief first, then instructs AI to populate scaffold files from that brief rather than from raw exploratory browsing.
8. Read `external/mex-main/src/sync/brief-builder.ts` and `src/pattern/index.ts`. Study how Mex turns drift issues into targeted repair prompts, supplies filesystem and git context, and appends new patterns into the scaffold instead of treating documentation as static.
9. Examine the first three drift checkers individually: `src/drift/checkers/path.ts`, `src/drift/checkers/edges.ts`, and `src/drift/checkers/index-sync.ts`. Document the actual detection logic, severity behavior, placeholder handling, and what kind of documentation drift each checker catches.
10. Examine the next three drift checkers individually: `src/drift/checkers/staleness.ts`, `src/drift/checkers/command.ts`, and `src/drift/checkers/dependency.ts`. Capture the exact thresholds and matching rules, including how staleness uses both days and commit counts, how commands are validated, and how dependency claims are compared to manifests.
11. Examine the final two drift checkers individually: `src/drift/checkers/cross-file.ts` and `src/drift/checkers/script-coverage.ts`. Explain how Mex detects contradictions across scaffold files and how it checks whether real scripts are missing from the scaffold narrative.
12. Compare Mex directly against current `Code_Environment/Public` capabilities: Spec Kit validation, memory frontmatter, documented memory/index structure, and other repo guidance files. Be precise about where Mex adds new capability versus where it overlaps with systems already covered by phases `001`, `003`, or `004`.
13. Before any deep-research run, ensure this phase folder contains the expected spec-kit docs for the chosen level. Validate the phase folder with:
    ```bash
    cd /Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public && bash .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/spec/validate.sh "/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main" --strict
    ```
14. After validation passes, run deep research using this exact topic:
    ```text
    Research the external repository at /Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/mex-main and identify concrete improvements for Code_Environment/Public, especially around knowledge scaffold design, drift detection, staleness checking, codebase-knowledge synchronization, and structured project memory.
    ```
15. Save all outputs inside this phase folder, especially under `research/`. Every finding must cite exact file paths, describe what Mex actually does, why it matters for `Code_Environment/Public`, whether it should be `adopt now`, `prototype later`, or `reject`, what subsystem it would affect, and what migration or validation risk comes with it. When research is complete, update `checklist.md`, create `implementation-summary.md`, and save memory with:
    ```bash
    cd /Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public && node .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/dist/memory/generate-context.js "/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main"
    ```

## 6. Research Questions

1. How does Mex's markdown-first scaffold change the tradeoff between navigability, editability, and correctness compared with database-backed memory systems?
2. How do the eight drift checkers compose into a practical health model, and where are the blind spots between checker coverage and actual scaffold truthfulness?
3. Are Mex's staleness thresholds (`30` warning days, `90` error days, `50` warning commits, `200` error commits) reasonable defaults, and how might similar thresholds be calibrated for `Code_Environment/Public`?
4. What makes Mex's path, edge, and index-sync checks useful as low-cost documentation integrity guards, and which of those ideas translate cleanly into Spec Kit?
5. How effective is the scoring model (`100 - 10/error - 3/warning - 1/info`) as a developer-facing health metric, and would `Code_Environment/Public` benefit from a comparable score or from severity-only reporting?
6. How does Mex's claim extraction model work in practice, especially its distinction between paths, commands, dependencies, and versions pulled from markdown?
7. What does Mex gain by checking real scripts that are undocumented in the scaffold, and how does that differ from existing `validate.sh` checks in this repo?
8. How does Mex's targeted sync flow convert static drift findings into precise AI repair prompts, and could `Code_Environment/Public` adopt a similar "fix only what's broken" pattern?
9. How do Mex's GROW rules and `pattern add` workflow support scaffold auto-growth after tasks rather than only during initialization?
10. What are the strongest arguments for keeping some project knowledge in markdown even when richer search or database systems exist elsewhere in the stack?

## 7. Do's

- Do examine each of the eight drift checkers individually rather than relying on the README summary alone.
- Do study the scoring algorithm and relate score behavior to developer incentives and operational clarity.
- Do analyze how scaffold growth happens after tasks through GROW rules, `pattern add`, targeted sync, and current-state updates.
- Do compare Mex's drift logic directly against `Code_Environment/Public` validation and memory/documentation surfaces.
- Do separate static drift detection from AI-assisted repair; they are distinct layers in Mex.
- Do highlight which Mex ideas help codebase-knowledge synchronization without requiring a database.
- Do address overlap with phase `001` explicitly so this phase stays focused on drift detection and scaffold design rather than generic persistence.

## 8. Don'ts

- Do not focus the research on npm packaging, build tooling, or release mechanics.
- Do not dismiss the markdown approach as primitive; markdown is the core persistence decision under evaluation.
- Do not confuse drift detection with AI-based validation or sync; the checkers are zero-token static analysis.
- Do not let README prose overrule source evidence from `src/`.
- Do not recommend importing Mex wholesale if the reusable value is only a subset of its design.
- Do not collapse this phase into memory-persistence comparisons already owned by phase `001`.
- Do not edit anything under `external/` or outside this phase folder.

## 9. Examples

### Example A: Staleness-checking finding

`src/drift/checkers/staleness.ts` does not rely on human judgment alone; it flags scaffold files by both elapsed days and commits since last change. A strong finding would explain why combining temporal and repository-activity signals is stronger than date-only freshness, show how that could improve Public's documentation hygiene, and classify the idea as `adopt now`, `prototype later`, or `reject`.

### Example B: Drift-detection composition finding

Mex does not use one monolithic "docs are wrong" check. `path.ts`, `edges.ts`, `index-sync.ts`, `command.ts`, `dependency.ts`, `cross-file.ts`, and `script-coverage.ts` each catch a different failure mode. A strong finding would describe how those checks work together, identify which subset would most improve `Code_Environment/Public`, and explain where Spec Kit validation already covers adjacent concerns.

## 10. Constraints

### 10.1 Error handling

- If a README claim cannot be verified in `src/`, mark it as unverified instead of repeating it as fact.
- If a checker behaves differently from the README summary, prefer the source code and call out the discrepancy explicitly.
- If a file path inside the external repo is missing, say so plainly and continue with the remaining evidence rather than guessing.
- If the external repo structure changes from the paths named here, adjust the reading path but preserve the same analytical order.

### 10.2 Scope

**IN SCOPE**

- scaffold structure and navigation model
- markdown persistence design
- all eight drift checkers
- scoring and health reporting
- staleness thresholds and git-based freshness signals
- targeted sync prompt generation
- scaffold auto-growth and pattern creation

## Assessment
- New information ratio: 0.30

## Recommended Next Focus
Compare this freshness-only Mex model against Phase 003’s true FSRS-style memory lifecycle, then spec one Public-native temporal contract with four separate lanes: `freshness provenance`, `retrieval decay`, `session attention decay`, and `archival or repair`. That will keep us from collapsing “old,” “irrelevant,” and “possibly wrong” into one score.

- **What it does**: Mex extracts typed markdown claims from inline code, code blocks, and dependency headings, then runs zero-token checks for missing paths, dead frontmatter edges, and `patterns/INDEX.md` drift. It already distinguishes real missing references from pattern/template placeholders by downgrading some path misses to warnings.
- **Why it matters for us**: This cleanly maps to our real gap. Spec Kit already has semantic retrieval, trigger recall, causal links, and health tooling, but it does not statically verify that markdown references still point to real files or that pattern indexes stay in sync.
- **Recommendation**: adopt now
- **Impact**: high

- **What it does**: Mex extracts typed markdown claims from inline code, code blocks, and dependency headings, then runs zero-token checks for missing paths, dead frontmatter edges, and `patterns/INDEX.md` drift. It already distinguishes real missing references from pattern/template placeholders by downgrading some path misses to warnings.
- **Why it matters for us**: This cleanly maps to our real gap. Spec Kit already has semantic retrieval, trigger recall, causal links, and health tooling, but it does not statically verify that markdown references still point to real files or that pattern indexes stay in sync.
- **Recommendation**: adopt now
- **Impact**: high
--- Iteration 21 ---
- **Why it matters**: This is useful after a conflict or drift event, but it does not prevent concurrent writes or resolve competing memory versions. It is a recovery workflow, not a merge-control system.
- **Recommendation**: adopt now
- **Impact**: medium

### Finding 4: Spec Kit Memory already has explicit shared vs private scoping with deny-by-default access control
- **Source**: [README.md](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/README.md#L893), [README.md](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/README.md#L1703), [shared-spaces.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/lib/collab/shared-spaces.ts#L507), [shared-memory.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/handlers/shared-memory.ts#L144), [stage1-candidate-gen.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/lib/search/pipeline/stage1-candidate-gen.ts#L985)
- **What it does**: Shared memory is opt-in. Spaces start locked, membership is role-based, caller identity must be exactly one user or agent, and retrieval filters candidates by `tenantId`, `userId`, `agentId`, and allowed `sharedSpaceId`s before ranking continues.
- **Why it matters**: This is the concrete multi-agent safety layer Mex lacks. Spec Kit distinguishes private scope from collaborative scope at query time and mutation time, rather than relying on directory boundaries alone.
- **Recommendation**: adopt now
- **Impact**: high

### Finding 5: Spec Kit Memory also has real concurrent-write and conflict controls that Mex does not
- **Source**: [context-server.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/context-server.ts#L1632), [spec-folder-mutex.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/handlers/save/spec-folder-mutex.ts#L1), [memory-save.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/handlers/memory-save.ts#L1513), [shared-spaces.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/lib/collab/shared-spaces.ts#L135), [shared-spaces.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/lib/collab/shared-spaces.ts#L678), [vector-index-schema.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/lib/search/vector-index-schema.ts#L1503)
- **What it does**: The server forces SQLite WAL mode, `memory_save` serializes writes with a per-spec-folder mutex, uses unique pending-file suffixes to avoid pending-file races, logs shared-space conflicts into `shared_space_conflicts`, and escalates repeat or high-risk collisions from `append_version` to `manual_merge`.
- **Why it matters**: This is a genuine concurrency and merge-conflict story: serialize same-scope saves, preserve data, and retain an auditable record when shared writes collide. That is materially stronger than Mex’s “repair after drift” approach.
- **Recommendation**: adopt now
- **Impact**: high

### Finding 6: Checkpoint restore adds another safety boundary by blocking saves and rolling back failed merge restores
- **Source**: [memory-save.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/handlers/memory-save.ts#L1080), [checkpoints.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/lib/storage/checkpoints.ts#L1097), [checkpoints.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/lib/storage/checkpoints.ts#L1855)
- **What it does**: `memory_save` refuses writes while checkpoint restore maintenance is active, and merge-mode restore uses savepoints so reinsertion failures roll back instead of leaving partially restored scoped data behind.
- **Why it matters**: This is important multi-agent safety during maintenance windows. It prevents a restore from interleaving with live writes and turning scoped memories or shared-space state into mixed snapshots.
- **Recommendation**: adopt now
- **Impact**: high

## Assessment
- New information ratio: 0.48

## Recommended Next Focus
Compare these backend safeguards against the user-facing surface. The next high-value pass is: how should `memory_search`, `memory_context`, and `/spec_kit:resume` expose shared-space conflicts, degraded trust, or `manual_merge` requirements so multi-agent collisions become visible workflow state instead of remaining mostly internal audit data.

RESEARCH BRIEF:
# $refine TIDD-EC Prompt: 002-mex-main

## 2. Role

You are a research specialist in knowledge scaffold architectures, drift detection systems, markdown-based persistence, and codebase-knowledge synchronization. Work like a systems analyst who can separate scaffold design, static drift checking, and targeted AI repair loops, then translate Mex's concrete mechanisms into practical improvements for `Code_Environment/Public`.

## 3. Task

Research Mex's markdown scaffold and drift detection patterns to identify practical, evidence-backed improvements for `Code_Environment/Public`, especially around staleness detection, codebase-knowledge synchronization, and structured project knowledge. Determine which Mex patterns should be `adopt now`, `prototype later`, or `reject`.

## 4. Context

### 4.1 System Description

Mex is a structured markdown scaffold with a TypeScript/Node.js CLI for persistent AI project memory. Instead of a database, it keeps project knowledge in navigable markdown files such as `AGENTS.md`, `ROUTER.md`, `context/*.md`, and `patterns/*.md`. Its defining mechanism is drift detection: eight static checkers validate scaffold claims against the real codebase without AI or token spend. Those checkers cover path validation, frontmatter edges, pattern index consistency, staleness based on git history, command existence, dependency claims, cross-file contradictions, and script coverage. Drift starts at score `100` and deducts `-10` per error, `-3` per warning, and `-1` per info. The scaffold is designed to grow after real work through pattern creation, targeted context updates, and current-state refreshes rather than one-time setup alone.

### 4.2 Cross-Phase Awareness Table

| Phase | System | Core Pattern | Overlap Risk | Differentiation |
|-------|--------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|
| 001 | Engram | MCP memory server (Go, SQLite+FTS5) | 002 (memory persistence) | Focus tool profiles, session lifecycle, topic keys |
| 002 | Mex | Markdown scaffold + drift detection | 001 (memory), 003 (memory) | Focus drift detection, scaffold structure, no-DB approach |
| 003 | Modus Memory | FSRS spaced repetition + BM25 | 001 (FTS5), 004 (local memory) | Focus FSRS decay, cross-referencing, librarian expansion |
| 004 | OpenCode Mnemosyne | Hybrid search (FTS5 + vector) | 001 (FTS5), 003 (local memory) | Focus vector search, plugin architecture, scoping |

### 4.3 What This Repo Already Has

`Code_Environment/Public` already has Spec Kit validation via `validate.sh` with severity-oriented checks, indexed memory files with frontmatter, and a `MEMORY.md`-style documentation/memory model. What it does **not** currently have is an automated drift checker that compares documentation or memory scaffolds against the actual filesystem, commands, dependencies, git staleness, or cross-file contradictions. Research should stay centered on that gap rather than re-covering general memory persistence already addressed by phase `001`.

## 5. Instructions

1. Treat `/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main` as the pre-approved phase folder. Skip Gate 3, keep all writes inside this phase folder, and treat everything under `external/` as read-only.
2. Start with `external/mex-main/README.md`. Read the positioning, the eight-checker summary, the drift-score model, the command surface, and the documented file structure before inferring anything from implementation details.
3. Immediately after the README, inspect the scaffold contract files in this order: `external/mex-main/AGENTS.md`, `external/mex-main/ROUTER.md`, `external/mex-main/SETUP.md`, and `external/mex-main/SYNC.md`. Treat these as the canonical markdown scaffold, growth loop, and resync workflow.
4. Map the scaffold structure explicitly: project-root tool instruction file, scaffold root, `context/` files, `patterns/INDEX.md`, pattern files, and the GROW step that updates project state and creates new patterns from real work.
5. Read `external/mex-main/src/cli.ts` next. Trace the user-facing layers in order: `mex init`, `mex check`, `mex sync`, `mex pattern add`, `mex watch`, and `mex commands`. Use this to anchor later claims about the relationship between setup, drift detection, targeted sync, and scaffold growth.
6. Read `external/mex-main/src/drift/index.ts`, `src/drift/claims.ts`, `src/drift/frontmatter.ts`, and `src/drift/scoring.ts`. Understand how Mex finds scaffold files, extracts claims from markdown, parses frontmatter edges, runs checker passes, and computes the final drift score.
7. Read `external/mex-main/src/scanner/index.ts` plus the scanner modules it composes. Focus on how Mex builds a structured brief first, then instructs AI to populate scaffold files from that brief rather than from raw exploratory browsing.
8. Read `external/mex-main/src/sync/brief-builder.ts` and `src/pattern/index.ts`. Study how Mex turns drift issues into targeted repair prompts, supplies filesystem and git context, and appends new patterns into the scaffold instead of treating documentation as static.
9. Examine the first three drift checkers individually: `src/drift/checkers/path.ts`, `src/drift/checkers/edges.ts`, and `src/drift/checkers/index-sync.ts`. Document the actual detection logic, severity behavior, placeholder handling, and what kind of documentation drift each checker catches.
10. Examine the next three drift checkers individually: `src/drift/checkers/staleness.ts`, `src/drift/checkers/command.ts`, and `src/drift/checkers/dependency.ts`. Capture the exact thresholds and matching rules, including how staleness uses both days and commit counts, how commands are validated, and how dependency claims are compared to manifests.
11. Examine the final two drift checkers individually: `src/drift/checkers/cross-file.ts` and `src/drift/checkers/script-coverage.ts`. Explain how Mex detects contradictions across scaffold files and how it checks whether real scripts are missing from the scaffold narrative.
12. Compare Mex directly against current `Code_Environment/Public` capabilities: Spec Kit validation, memory frontmatter, documented memory/index structure, and other repo guidance files. Be precise about where Mex adds new capability versus where it overlaps with systems already covered by phases `001`, `003`, or `004`.
13. Before any deep-research run, ensure this phase folder contains the expected spec-kit docs for the chosen level. Validate the phase folder with:
    ```bash
    cd /Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public && bash .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/spec/validate.sh "/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main" --strict
    ```
14. After validation passes, run deep research using this exact topic:
    ```text
    Research the external repository at /Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/mex-main and identify concrete improvements for Code_Environment/Public, especially around knowledge scaffold design, drift detection, staleness checking, codebase-knowledge synchronization, and structured project memory.
    ```
15. Save all outputs inside this phase folder, especially under `research/`. Every finding must cite exact file paths, describe what Mex actually does, why it matters for `Code_Environment/Public`, whether it should be `adopt now`, `prototype later`, or `reject`, what subsystem it would affect, and what migration or validation risk comes with it. When research is complete, update `checklist.md`, create `implementation-summary.md`, and save memory with:
    ```bash
    cd /Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public && node .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/dist/memory/generate-context.js "/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main"
    ```

## 9. Examples

### Example A: Staleness-checking finding

`src/drift/checkers/staleness.ts` does not rely on human judgment alone; it flags scaffold files by both elapsed days and commits since last change. A strong finding would explain why combining temporal and repository-activity signals is stronger than date-only freshness, show how that could improve Public's documentation hygiene, and classify the idea as `adopt now`, `prototype later`, or `reject`.

### Example B: Drift-detection composition finding

Mex does not use one monolithic "docs are wrong" check. `path.ts`, `edges.ts`, `index-sync.ts`, `command.ts`, `dependency.ts`, `cross-file.ts`, and `script-coverage.ts` each catch a different failure mode. A strong finding would describe how those checks work together, identify which subset would most improve `Code_Environment/Public`, and explain where Spec Kit validation already covers adjacent concerns.

## 10. Constraints

### 10.1 Error handling

- If a README claim cannot be verified in `src/`, mark it as unverified instead of repeating it as fact.
- If a checker behaves differently from the README summary, prefer the source code and call out the discrepancy explicitly.
- If a file path inside the external repo is missing, say so plainly and continue with the remaining evidence rather than guessing.
- If the external repo structure changes from the paths named here, adjust the reading path but preserve the same analytical order.

### 10.2 Scope

**IN SCOPE**

- scaffold structure and navigation model
- markdown persistence design
- all eight drift checkers
- scoring and health reporting
- staleness thresholds and git-based freshness signals
- targeted sync prompt generation
- scaffold auto-growth and pattern creation
- comparison with `Code_Environment/Public` validation and memory surfaces

### Finding 5: Spec Kit Memory also has real concurrent-write and conflict controls that Mex does not

- **What it does**: The server forces SQLite WAL mode, `memory_save` serializes writes with a per-spec-folder mutex, uses unique pending-file suffixes to avoid pending-file races, logs shared-space conflicts into `shared_space_conflicts`, and escalates repeat or high-risk collisions from `append_version` to `manual_merge`.
- **Why it matters**: This is a genuine concurrency and merge-conflict story: serialize same-scope saves, preserve data, and retain an auditable record when shared writes collide. That is materially stronger than Mex’s “repair after drift” approach.
- **Recommendation**: adopt now
- **Impact**: high

### Finding 6: Checkpoint restore adds another safety boundary by blocking saves and rolling back failed merge restores
- **Source**: [memory-save.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/handlers/memory-save.ts#L1080), [checkpoints.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/lib/storage/checkpoints.ts#L1097), [checkpoints.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/lib/storage/checkpoints.ts#L1855)
- **What it does**: `memory_save` refuses writes while checkpoint restore maintenance is active, and merge-mode restore uses savepoints so reinsertion failures roll back instead of leaving partially restored scoped data behind.
- **Why it matters**: This is important multi-agent safety during maintenance windows. It prevents a restore from interleaving with live writes and turning scoped memories or shared-space state into mixed snapshots.
- **Recommendation**: adopt now
- **Impact**: high

## Assessment
- New information ratio: 0.48

## Recommended Next Focus
Compare these backend safeguards against the user-facing surface. The next high-value pass is: how should `memory_search`, `memory_context`, and `/spec_kit:resume` expose shared-space conflicts, degraded trust, or `manual_merge` requirements so multi-agent collisions become visible workflow state instead of remaining mostly internal audit data.

## Findings
### Finding 1: Static markdown reference integrity is the only clear adopt-now slice
- **Source**: [README.md](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/README.md#L72), [claims.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/src/drift/claims.ts#L48), [drift/index.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/src/drift/index.ts#L17), [path.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/src/drift/checkers/path.ts#L8), [edges.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/src/drift/checkers/edges.ts#L5), [index-sync.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/src/drift/checkers/index-sync.ts#L6)
- **What it does**: Mex extracts typed markdown claims from inline code, code blocks, and dependency headings, then runs zero-token checks for missing paths, dead frontmatter edges, and `patterns/INDEX.md` drift. It already distinguishes real missing references from pattern/template placeholders by downgrading some path misses to warnings.
- **Why it matters for us**: This cleanly maps to our real gap. Spec Kit already has semantic retrieval, trigger recall, causal links, and health tooling, but it does not statically verify that markdown references still point to real files or that pattern indexes stay in sync.
- **Recommendation**: adopt now
- **Impact**: high
--- Iteration 21 ---
- **Why it matters**: The right architecture is not “semantic vs lexical” as a winner-take-all choice. It is “semantic for discovery, lexical for anchoring, graph for structure, temporal and session signals for ranking.” That is the real hybrid advantage.
- **Recommendation**: adopt now
- **Impact**: high

### Finding 5: Mex is strong lexical truth maintenance, not a competing semantic retrieval engine
- **Source**: [README.md](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/README.md#L72), [drift/index.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/src/drift/index.ts#L17), [claims.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/src/drift/claims.ts#L36)
- **What it does**: Mex extracts lexical claims from markdown: paths, commands, dependencies, versions, frontmatter edges, and pattern index membership. Its drift engine runs static checks across the scaffold and scores integrity issues without embeddings or vector search.
- **Why it matters**: Mex will beat semantic retrieval on “is this markdown claim still true?” because that is a static lexical verification problem. But it does not replace semantic memory search for conceptual recall.
- **Recommendation**: adopt now
- **Impact**: high

### Finding 6: Mex’s scanner and targeted sync show the right complement: lexical or structural grounding first, AI repair second
- **Source**: [scanner/index.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/src/scanner/index.ts#L20), [sync/brief-builder.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/src/sync/brief-builder.ts#L7), [ROUTER.md](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/ROUTER.md#L43), [AGENTS.md](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/AGENTS.md#L37)
- **What it does**: Mex first builds a structured brief from manifests, entry points, folder tree, tooling, and README, then tells AI to reason from that brief. During sync it only feeds flagged files, file-local issues, nearby filesystem context, and recent git diff.
- **Why it matters**: The transferable pattern is not “replace search with markdown.” It is “use lexical or structural evidence to narrow the surface, then let AI update only the broken slice.” That is an ideal companion to Spec Kit’s hybrid retrieval stack.
- **Recommendation**: prototype later
- **Impact**: medium

### Finding 7: The missing contract is explicit lane arbitration and user-visible attribution
- **Source**: [hybrid-search.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/lib/search/hybrid-search.ts#L1684), [sqlite-fts.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/lib/search/sqlite-fts.ts#L28)
- **What it does**: Raw candidate collection already falls back from hybrid execution to FTS and then BM25. The lexical subsystem also tracks `lexicalPath` and failure states such as `missing_table` or `no_such_module_fts5`.
- **Why it matters**: We already have the mechanics of lane degradation, but not a strong outward contract explaining which lane dominated, which failed, and why a result should be trusted. That makes hybrid behavior harder to debug and tune.
- **Recommendation**: NEW FEATURE
- **Impact**: medium

## Assessment
- New information ratio: 0.44

## Recommended Next Focus
Design a concrete retrieval policy matrix for Spec Kit Memory with four explicit outcomes: `lexical-first`, `semantic-first`, `hybrid-balanced`, and `graph-first`. Tie each mode to query classes, required result attribution, degradation behavior, and eval queries so we can prove when BM25/FTS should dominate, when embeddings should dominate, and when Mex-style static drift checks should run as a separate integrity layer rather than inside the recall stack.

RESEARCH BRIEF:
# $refine TIDD-EC Prompt: 002-mex-main

## 2. Role

You are a research specialist in knowledge scaffold architectures, drift detection systems, markdown-based persistence, and codebase-knowledge synchronization. Work like a systems analyst who can separate scaffold design, static drift checking, and targeted AI repair loops, then translate Mex's concrete mechanisms into practical improvements for `Code_Environment/Public`.

## 3. Task

Research Mex's markdown scaffold and drift detection patterns to identify practical, evidence-backed improvements for `Code_Environment/Public`, especially around staleness detection, codebase-knowledge synchronization, and structured project knowledge. Determine which Mex patterns should be `adopt now`, `prototype later`, or `reject`.

## 4. Context

### 4.1 System Description

Mex is a structured markdown scaffold with a TypeScript/Node.js CLI for persistent AI project memory. Instead of a database, it keeps project knowledge in navigable markdown files such as `AGENTS.md`, `ROUTER.md`, `context/*.md`, and `patterns/*.md`. Its defining mechanism is drift detection: eight static checkers validate scaffold claims against the real codebase without AI or token spend. Those checkers cover path validation, frontmatter edges, pattern index consistency, staleness based on git history, command existence, dependency claims, cross-file contradictions, and script coverage. Drift starts at score `100` and deducts `-10` per error, `-3` per warning, and `-1` per info. The scaffold is designed to grow after real work through pattern creation, targeted context updates, and current-state refreshes rather than one-time setup alone.

### 4.2 Cross-Phase Awareness Table

| Phase | System | Core Pattern | Overlap Risk | Differentiation |
|-------|--------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|
| 001 | Engram | MCP memory server (Go, SQLite+FTS5) | 002 (memory persistence) | Focus tool profiles, session lifecycle, topic keys |
| 002 | Mex | Markdown scaffold + drift detection | 001 (memory), 003 (memory) | Focus drift detection, scaffold structure, no-DB approach |
| 003 | Modus Memory | FSRS spaced repetition + BM25 | 001 (FTS5), 004 (local memory) | Focus FSRS decay, cross-referencing, librarian expansion |
| 004 | OpenCode Mnemosyne | Hybrid search (FTS5 + vector) | 001 (FTS5), 003 (local memory) | Focus vector search, plugin architecture, scoping |

### 4.3 What This Repo Already Has

`Code_Environment/Public` already has Spec Kit validation via `validate.sh` with severity-oriented checks, indexed memory files with frontmatter, and a `MEMORY.md`-style documentation/memory model. What it does **not** currently have is an automated drift checker that compares documentation or memory scaffolds against the actual filesystem, commands, dependencies, git staleness, or cross-file contradictions. Research should stay centered on that gap rather than re-covering general memory persistence already addressed by phase `001`.

## 5. Instructions

1. Treat `/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main` as the pre-approved phase folder. Skip Gate 3, keep all writes inside this phase folder, and treat everything under `external/` as read-only.
2. Start with `external/mex-main/README.md`. Read the positioning, the eight-checker summary, the drift-score model, the command surface, and the documented file structure before inferring anything from implementation details.
3. Immediately after the README, inspect the scaffold contract files in this order: `external/mex-main/AGENTS.md`, `external/mex-main/ROUTER.md`, `external/mex-main/SETUP.md`, and `external/mex-main/SYNC.md`. Treat these as the canonical markdown scaffold, growth loop, and resync workflow.
4. Map the scaffold structure explicitly: project-root tool instruction file, scaffold root, `context/` files, `patterns/INDEX.md`, pattern files, and the GROW step that updates project state and creates new patterns from real work.
5. Read `external/mex-main/src/cli.ts` next. Trace the user-facing layers in order: `mex init`, `mex check`, `mex sync`, `mex pattern add`, `mex watch`, and `mex commands`. Use this to anchor later claims about the relationship between setup, drift detection, targeted sync, and scaffold growth.
6. Read `external/mex-main/src/drift/index.ts`, `src/drift/claims.ts`, `src/drift/frontmatter.ts`, and `src/drift/scoring.ts`. Understand how Mex finds scaffold files, extracts claims from markdown, parses frontmatter edges, runs checker passes, and computes the final drift score.
7. Read `external/mex-main/src/scanner/index.ts` plus the scanner modules it composes. Focus on how Mex builds a structured brief first, then instructs AI to populate scaffold files from that brief rather than from raw exploratory browsing.
8. Read `external/mex-main/src/sync/brief-builder.ts` and `src/pattern/index.ts`. Study how Mex turns drift issues into targeted repair prompts, supplies filesystem and git context, and appends new patterns into the scaffold instead of treating documentation as static.
9. Examine the first three drift checkers individually: `src/drift/checkers/path.ts`, `src/drift/checkers/edges.ts`, and `src/drift/checkers/index-sync.ts`. Document the actual detection logic, severity behavior, placeholder handling, and what kind of documentation drift each checker catches.
10. Examine the next three drift checkers individually: `src/drift/checkers/staleness.ts`, `src/drift/checkers/command.ts`, and `src/drift/checkers/dependency.ts`. Capture the exact thresholds and matching rules, including how staleness uses both days and commit counts, how commands are validated, and how dependency claims are compared to manifests.
11. Examine the final two drift checkers individually: `src/drift/checkers/cross-file.ts` and `src/drift/checkers/script-coverage.ts`. Explain how Mex detects contradictions across scaffold files and how it checks whether real scripts are missing from the scaffold narrative.
12. Compare Mex directly against current `Code_Environment/Public` capabilities: Spec Kit validation, memory frontmatter, documented memory/index structure, and other repo guidance files. Be precise about where Mex adds new capability versus where it overlaps with systems already covered by phases `001`, `003`, or `004`.
13. Before any deep-research run, ensure this phase folder contains the expected spec-kit docs for the chosen level. Validate the phase folder with:
    ```bash
    cd /Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public && bash .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/spec/validate.sh "/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main" --strict
    ```
14. After validation passes, run deep research using this exact topic:
    ```text
    Research the external repository at /Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/mex-main and identify concrete improvements for Code_Environment/Public, especially around knowledge scaffold design, drift detection, staleness checking, codebase-knowledge synchronization, and structured project memory.
    ```
15. Save all outputs inside this phase folder, especially under `research/`. Every finding must cite exact file paths, describe what Mex actually does, why it matters for `Code_Environment/Public`, whether it should be `adopt now`, `prototype later`, or `reject`, what subsystem it would affect, and what migration or validation risk comes with it. When research is complete, update `checklist.md`, create `implementation-summary.md`, and save memory with:
    ```bash
    cd /Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public && node .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/dist/memory/generate-context.js "/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main"
    ```

## 6. Research Questions

1. How does Mex's markdown-first scaffold change the tradeoff between navigability, editability, and correctness compared with database-backed memory systems?
2. How do the eight drift checkers compose into a practical health model, and where are the blind spots between checker coverage and actual scaffold truthfulness?
3. Are Mex's staleness thresholds (`30` warning days, `90` error days, `50` warning commits, `200` error commits) reasonable defaults, and how might similar thresholds be calibrated for `Code_Environment/Public`?
4. What makes Mex's path, edge, and index-sync checks useful as low-cost documentation integrity guards, and which of those ideas translate cleanly into Spec Kit?
5. How effective is the scoring model (`100 - 10/error - 3/warning - 1/info`) as a developer-facing health metric, and would `Code_Environment/Public` benefit from a comparable score or from severity-only reporting?
6. How does Mex's claim extraction model work in practice, especially its distinction between paths, commands, dependencies, and versions pulled from markdown?
7. What does Mex gain by checking real scripts that are undocumented in the scaffold, and how does that differ from existing `validate.sh` checks in this repo?
8. How does Mex's targeted sync flow convert static drift findings into precise AI repair prompts, and could `Code_Environment/Public` adopt a similar "fix only what's broken" pattern?
9. How do Mex's GROW rules and `pattern add` workflow support scaffold auto-growth after tasks rather than only during initialization?
10. What are the strongest arguments for keeping some project knowledge in markdown even when richer search or database systems exist elsewhere in the stack?

## 7. Do's

- Do examine each of the eight drift checkers individually rather than relying on the README summary alone.
- Do study the scoring algorithm and relate score behavior to developer incentives and operational clarity.
- Do analyze how scaffold growth happens after tasks through GROW rules, `pattern add`, targeted sync, and current-state updates.
- Do compare Mex's drift logic directly against `Code_Environment/Public` validation and memory/documentation surfaces.
- Do separate static drift detection from AI-assisted repair; they are distinct layers in Mex.
- Do highlight which Mex ideas help codebase-knowledge synchronization without requiring a database.
- Do address overlap with phase `001` explicitly so this phase stays focused on drift detection and scaffold design rather than generic persistence.

## 8. Don'ts

- Do not focus the research on npm packaging, build tooling, or release mechanics.
- Do not dismiss the markdown approach as primitive; markdown is the core persistence decision under evaluation.
- Do not confuse drift detection with AI-based validation or sync; the checkers are zero-token static analysis.
- Do not let README prose overrule source evidence from `src/`.
- Do not recommend importing Mex wholesale if the reusable value is only a subset of its design.
- Do not collapse this phase into memory-persistence comparisons already owned by phase `001`.
- Do not edit anything under `external/` or outside this phase folder.

## 9. Examples

### Example A: Staleness-checking finding

`src/drift/checkers/staleness.ts` does not rely on human judgment alone; it flags scaffold files by both elapsed days and commits since last change. A strong finding would explain why combining temporal and repository-activity signals is stronger than date-only freshness, show how that could improve Public's documentation hygiene, and classify the idea as `adopt now`, `prototype later`, or `reject`.

### Example B: Drift-detection composition finding

Mex does not use one monolithic "docs are wrong" check. `path.ts`, `edges.ts`, `index-sync.ts`, `command.ts`, `dependency.ts`, `cross-file.ts`, and `script-coverage.ts` each catch a different failure mode. A strong finding would describe how those checks work together, identify which subset would most improve `Code_Environment/Public`, and explain where Spec Kit validation already covers adjacent concerns.

## 10. Constraints

### 10.1 Error handling

- If a README claim cannot be verified in `src/`, mark it as unverified instead of repeating it as fact.
- If a checker behaves differently from the README summary, prefer the source code and call out the discrepancy explicitly.
- If a file path inside the external repo is missing, say so plainly and continue with the remaining evidence rather than guessing.
- If the external repo structure changes from the paths named here, adjust the reading path but preserve the same analytical order.

### 10.2 Scope

**IN SCOPE**

- scaffold structure and navigation model
- markdown persistence design
- all eight drift checkers
- scoring and health reporting
- staleness thresholds and git-based freshness signals
- targeted sync prompt generation
- scaffold auto-growth and pattern creation
- comparison with `Code_Environment/Public` validation and memory surfaces

**OUT OF SCOPE**

- generic Node.js packaging analysis
- benchmarking build performance
- speculative database redesigns not grounded in Mex evidence
- unrelated hybrid-RAG implementation details
- re-litigating memory persistence questions already owned by phase `001`

### 10.3 Prioritization framework

Rank findings in this order: drift-detection value for `Code_Environment/Public`, documentation-to-code synchronization impact, scaffold simplicity-to-maintainability ratio, staleness-signal usefulness, compatibility with existing Spec Kit workflows, implementation cost, and cross-phase differentiation from phases `001`, `003`, and `004`.

## 11. Deliverables

- `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`, and any level-required spec docs present and valid before deep research starts
- `research/research.md` as the canonical report with at least 5 evidence-backed findings
- explicit comparison between Mex and current `Code_Environment/Public` documentation/memory validation capabilities

- **Source**: [README.md](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/README.md#L72), [claims.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/src/drift/claims.ts#L48), [drift/index.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/src/drift/index.ts#L17), [path.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/src/drift/checkers/path.ts#L8), [edges.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/src/drift/checkers/edges.ts#L5), [index-sync.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/src/drift/checkers/index-sync.ts#L6)
- **What it does**: Mex extracts typed markdown claims from inline code, code blocks, and dependency headings, then runs zero-token checks for missing paths, dead frontmatter edges, and `patterns/INDEX.md` drift. It already distinguishes real missing references from pattern/template placeholders by downgrading some path misses to warnings.
- **Why it matters for us**: This cleanly maps to our real gap. Spec Kit already has semantic retrieval, trigger recall, causal links, and health tooling, but it does not statically verify that markdown references still point to real files or that pattern indexes stay in sync.
- **Recommendation**: adopt now
- **Impact**: high
--- Iteration 21 ---
- **Why it matters**: This is excellent DX because the tool never traps the developer inside opaque automation. Spec Kit already has rich traces and dry-run save validation, but it lacks a similarly unified “show me the exact repair bundle” experience for memory repair, readiness recovery, or save troubleshooting.
- **Recommendation**: adopt now
- **Impact**: high

### Finding 3: Mex’s detect-fix-verify loop is a stronger maintenance workflow than our current toolbox-style repair model
- **Source**: [external/README.md](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/README.md#L102), [external/src/sync/index.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/src/sync/index.ts#L29), [external/src/reporter.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/src/reporter.ts#L16), [mcp_server/README.md](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/README.md#L763)
- **What it does**: `mex sync` runs drift detection, narrows to the right files, offers interactive or prompt mode, executes a repair pass, reruns drift detection, prints score delta, and loops until the user stops or the score reaches the target. The workflow is centered on closure, not just diagnosis.
- **Why it matters**: Spec Kit has the ingredients, not the same developer flow. We expose `memory_health`, `memory_index_scan`, `code_graph_scan`, `session_bootstrap`, save dry-runs, and traces, but developers still need to know which tool to call next and in what order. Mex’s loop is the DX pattern to steal: a guided “doctor/repair” command that owns diagnosis, repair suggestions, rerun, and stop conditions.
- **Recommendation**: NEW FEATURE
- **Impact**: high

### Finding 4: Mex’s low-noise post-commit hook is a good hygiene pattern because it only interrupts on failure
- **Source**: [external/README.md](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/README.md#L111), [external/src/watch.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/src/watch.ts#L8), [mcp_server/README.md](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/README.md#L497)
- **What it does**: `mex watch` installs a post-commit hook that runs `check --quiet` and prints nothing on a perfect score. The hook is additive, marker-based, and removable without clobbering unrelated hook logic.
- **Why it matters**: Spec Kit already has filesystem watching for index maintenance, but that is infrastructure behavior, not developer-facing feedback. Mex shows a better DX pattern for background hygiene: silent when healthy, visible only when action is needed. That would fit nicely for optional local reminders about stale graph state, broken save quality, or degraded memory health.
- **Recommendation**: prototype later
- **Impact**: medium

### Finding 5: Mex wins on command discoverability because it exposes a tiny, memorable verb set with sharp error messages
- **Source**: [external/src/cli.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/src/cli.ts#L8), [external/src/config.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/src/config.ts#L9), [mcp_server/README.md](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/README.md#L557), [mcp_server/README.md](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/README.md#L1531), [mcp_server/context-server.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/context-server.ts#L684)
- **What it does**: Mex keeps the public surface to a few verbs: `setup`, `check`, `sync`, `init`, `pattern add`, `watch`, `commands`. It also fails crisply when you are inside `.mex`, when the scaffold is incomplete, or when there is no git repo. The `commands` subcommand doubles as a built-in cheat sheet.
- **Why it matters**: Spec Kit is more powerful, but its DX cost is real: 47 tools, multiple recovery surfaces, several maintenance tools, and separate scripts. We already partially compensate with `memory_context`, `session_bootstrap`, common-pattern docs, troubleshooting, and response hints, but Mex’s smaller surface is easier to teach, remember, and debug.
- **Recommendation**: adopt now
- **Impact**: high

## Assessment
- New information ratio: 0.42

## Recommended Next Focus
Define a concrete `spec-kit doctor` DX surface that maps existing capabilities into one guided flow: `bootstrap -> diagnose -> repair suggestion -> optional auto-repair -> recheck -> next call hints`. The highest-value follow-up is to design that command contract around current tools we already have: `session_bootstrap`, `memory_health`, `memory_save(dryRun)`, `code_graph_scan`, `memory_index_scan`, and trace-enabled retrieval responses.

RESEARCH BRIEF:
# $refine TIDD-EC Prompt: 002-mex-main

## 2. Role

You are a research specialist in knowledge scaffold architectures, drift detection systems, markdown-based persistence, and codebase-knowledge synchronization. Work like a systems analyst who can separate scaffold design, static drift checking, and targeted AI repair loops, then translate Mex's concrete mechanisms into practical improvements for `Code_Environment/Public`.

## 3. Task

Research Mex's markdown scaffold and drift detection patterns to identify practical, evidence-backed improvements for `Code_Environment/Public`, especially around staleness detection, codebase-knowledge synchronization, and structured project knowledge. Determine which Mex patterns should be `adopt now`, `prototype later`, or `reject`.

## 4. Context

### 4.1 System Description

Mex is a structured markdown scaffold with a TypeScript/Node.js CLI for persistent AI project memory. Instead of a database, it keeps project knowledge in navigable markdown files such as `AGENTS.md`, `ROUTER.md`, `context/*.md`, and `patterns/*.md`. Its defining mechanism is drift detection: eight static checkers validate scaffold claims against the real codebase without AI or token spend. Those checkers cover path validation, frontmatter edges, pattern index consistency, staleness based on git history, command existence, dependency claims, cross-file contradictions, and script coverage. Drift starts at score `100` and deducts `-10` per error, `-3` per warning, and `-1` per info. The scaffold is designed to grow after real work through pattern creation, targeted context updates, and current-state refreshes rather than one-time setup alone.

### 4.2 Cross-Phase Awareness Table

| Phase | System | Core Pattern | Overlap Risk | Differentiation |
|-------|--------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|
| 001 | Engram | MCP memory server (Go, SQLite+FTS5) | 002 (memory persistence) | Focus tool profiles, session lifecycle, topic keys |
| 002 | Mex | Markdown scaffold + drift detection | 001 (memory), 003 (memory) | Focus drift detection, scaffold structure, no-DB approach |
| 003 | Modus Memory | FSRS spaced repetition + BM25 | 001 (FTS5), 004 (local memory) | Focus FSRS decay, cross-referencing, librarian expansion |
| 004 | OpenCode Mnemosyne | Hybrid search (FTS5 + vector) | 001 (FTS5), 003 (local memory) | Focus vector search, plugin architecture, scoping |

### 4.3 What This Repo Already Has

`Code_Environment/Public` already has Spec Kit validation via `validate.sh` with severity-oriented checks, indexed memory files with frontmatter, and a `MEMORY.md`-style documentation/memory model. What it does **not** currently have is an automated drift checker that compares documentation or memory scaffolds against the actual filesystem, commands, dependencies, git staleness, or cross-file contradictions. Research should stay centered on that gap rather than re-covering general memory persistence already addressed by phase `001`.

## 5. Instructions

1. Treat `/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main` as the pre-approved phase folder. Skip Gate 3, keep all writes inside this phase folder, and treat everything under `external/` as read-only.
2. Start with `external/mex-main/README.md`. Read the positioning, the eight-checker summary, the drift-score model, the command surface, and the documented file structure before inferring anything from implementation details.
3. Immediately after the README, inspect the scaffold contract files in this order: `external/mex-main/AGENTS.md`, `external/mex-main/ROUTER.md`, `external/mex-main/SETUP.md`, and `external/mex-main/SYNC.md`. Treat these as the canonical markdown scaffold, growth loop, and resync workflow.
4. Map the scaffold structure explicitly: project-root tool instruction file, scaffold root, `context/` files, `patterns/INDEX.md`, pattern files, and the GROW step that updates project state and creates new patterns from real work.
5. Read `external/mex-main/src/cli.ts` next. Trace the user-facing layers in order: `mex init`, `mex check`, `mex sync`, `mex pattern add`, `mex watch`, and `mex commands`. Use this to anchor later claims about the relationship between setup, drift detection, targeted sync, and scaffold growth.
6. Read `external/mex-main/src/drift/index.ts`, `src/drift/claims.ts`, `src/drift/frontmatter.ts`, and `src/drift/scoring.ts`. Understand how Mex finds scaffold files, extracts claims from markdown, parses frontmatter edges, runs checker passes, and computes the final drift score.
7. Read `external/mex-main/src/scanner/index.ts` plus the scanner modules it composes. Focus on how Mex builds a structured brief first, then instructs AI to populate scaffold files from that brief rather than from raw exploratory browsing.
8. Read `external/mex-main/src/sync/brief-builder.ts` and `src/pattern/index.ts`. Study how Mex turns drift issues into targeted repair prompts, supplies filesystem and git context, and appends new patterns into the scaffold instead of treating documentation as static.
9. Examine the first three drift checkers individually: `src/drift/checkers/path.ts`, `src/drift/checkers/edges.ts`, and `src/drift/checkers/index-sync.ts`. Document the actual detection logic, severity behavior, placeholder handling, and what kind of documentation drift each checker catches.
10. Examine the next three drift checkers individually: `src/drift/checkers/staleness.ts`, `src/drift/checkers/command.ts`, and `src/drift/checkers/dependency.ts`. Capture the exact thresholds and matching rules, including how staleness uses both days and commit counts, how commands are validated, and how dependency claims are compared to manifests.
11. Examine the final two drift checkers individually: `src/drift/checkers/cross-file.ts` and `src/drift/checkers/script-coverage.ts`. Explain how Mex detects contradictions across scaffold files and how it checks whether real scripts are missing from the scaffold narrative.
12. Compare Mex directly against current `Code_Environment/Public` capabilities: Spec Kit validation, memory frontmatter, documented memory/index structure, and other repo guidance files. Be precise about where Mex adds new capability versus where it overlaps with systems already covered by phases `001`, `003`, or `004`.
13. Before any deep-research run, ensure this phase folder contains the expected spec-kit docs for the chosen level. Validate the phase folder with:
    ```bash
    cd /Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public && bash .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/spec/validate.sh "/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main" --strict
    ```
14. After validation passes, run deep research using this exact topic:
    ```text
    Research the external repository at /Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/mex-main and identify concrete improvements for Code_Environment/Public, especially around knowledge scaffold design, drift detection, staleness checking, codebase-knowledge synchronization, and structured project memory.
    ```
15. Save all outputs inside this phase folder, especially under `research/`. Every finding must cite exact file paths, describe what Mex actually does, why it matters for `Code_Environment/Public`, whether it should be `adopt now`, `prototype later`, or `reject`, what subsystem it would affect, and what migration or validation risk comes with it. When research is complete, update `checklist.md`, create `implementation-summary.md`, and save memory with:
    ```bash
    cd /Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public && node .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/dist/memory/generate-context.js "/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main"
    ```

## 6. Research Questions

1. How does Mex's markdown-first scaffold change the tradeoff between navigability, editability, and correctness compared with database-backed memory systems?
2. How do the eight drift checkers compose into a practical health model, and where are the blind spots between checker coverage and actual scaffold truthfulness?
3. Are Mex's staleness thresholds (`30` warning days, `90` error days, `50` warning commits, `200` error commits) reasonable defaults, and how might similar thresholds be calibrated for `Code_Environment/Public`?
4. What makes Mex's path, edge, and index-sync checks useful as low-cost documentation integrity guards, and which of those ideas translate cleanly into Spec Kit?
5. How effective is the scoring model (`100 - 10/error - 3/warning - 1/info`) as a developer-facing health metric, and would `Code_Environment/Public` benefit from a comparable score or from severity-only reporting?
6. How does Mex's claim extraction model work in practice, especially its distinction between paths, commands, dependencies, and versions pulled from markdown?
7. What does Mex gain by checking real scripts that are undocumented in the scaffold, and how does that differ from existing `validate.sh` checks in this repo?
8. How does Mex's targeted sync flow convert static drift findings into precise AI repair prompts, and could `Code_Environment/Public` adopt a similar "fix only what's broken" pattern?
9. How do Mex's GROW rules and `pattern add` workflow support scaffold auto-growth after tasks rather than only during initialization?
10. What are the strongest arguments for keeping some project knowledge in markdown even when richer search or database systems exist elsewhere in the stack?

## 7. Do's

- Do examine each of the eight drift checkers individually rather than relying on the README summary alone.
- Do study the scoring algorithm and relate score behavior to developer incentives and operational clarity.
- Do analyze how scaffold growth happens after tasks through GROW rules, `pattern add`, targeted sync, and current-state updates.
- Do compare Mex's drift logic directly against `Code_Environment/Public` validation and memory/documentation surfaces.
- Do separate static drift detection from AI-assisted repair; they are distinct layers in Mex.
- Do highlight which Mex ideas help codebase-knowledge synchronization without requiring a database.
- Do address overlap with phase `001` explicitly so this phase stays focused on drift detection and scaffold design rather than generic persistence.

## 8. Don'ts

- Do not focus the research on npm packaging, build tooling, or release mechanics.
- Do not dismiss the markdown approach as primitive; markdown is the core persistence decision under evaluation.
- Do not confuse drift detection with AI-based validation or sync; the checkers are zero-token static analysis.
- Do not let README prose overrule source evidence from `src/`.
- Do not recommend importing Mex wholesale if the reusable value is only a subset of its design.
- Do not collapse this phase into memory-persistence comparisons already owned by phase `001`.
- Do not edit anything under `external/` or outside this phase folder.

## 9. Examples

### Example A: Staleness-checking finding

`src/drift/checkers/staleness.ts` does not rely on human judgment alone; it flags scaffold files by both elapsed days and commits since last change. A strong finding would explain why combining temporal and repository-activity signals is stronger than date-only freshness, show how that could improve Public's documentation hygiene, and classify the idea as `adopt now`, `prototype later`, or `reject`.

### Example B: Drift-detection composition finding

Mex does not use one monolithic "docs are wrong" check. `path.ts`, `edges.ts`, `index-sync.ts`, `command.ts`, `dependency.ts`, `cross-file.ts`, and `script-coverage.ts` each catch a different failure mode. A strong finding would describe how those checks work together, identify which subset would most improve `Code_Environment/Public`, and explain where Spec Kit validation already covers adjacent concerns.

## 10. Constraints

### 10.1 Error handling

- If a README claim cannot be verified in `src/`, mark it as unverified instead of repeating it as fact.
- If a checker behaves differently from the README summary, prefer the source code and call out the discrepancy explicitly.
- If a file path inside the external repo is missing, say so plainly and continue with the remaining evidence rather than guessing.
- If the external repo structure changes from the paths named here, adjust the reading path but preserve the same analytical order.

### 10.2 Scope

**IN SCOPE**

- scaffold structure and navigation model
- markdown persistence design
- all eight drift checkers
- scoring and health reporting
- staleness thresholds and git-based freshness signals
- targeted sync prompt generation
- scaffold auto-growth and pattern creation
- comparison with `Code_Environment/Public` validation and memory surfaces

**OUT OF SCOPE**

- generic Node.js packaging analysis
- benchmarking build performance
- speculative database redesigns not grounded in Mex evidence
- unrelated hybrid-RAG implementation details
- re-litigating memory persistence questions already owned by phase `001`

### 10.3 Prioritization framework

Rank findings in this order: drift-detection value for `Code_Environment/Public`, documentation-to-code synchronization impact, scaffold simplicity-to-maintainability ratio, staleness-signal usefulness, compatibility with existing Spec Kit workflows, implementation cost, and cross-phase differentiation from phases `001`, `003`, and `004`.

## 11. Deliverables

- `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`, and any level-required spec docs present and valid before deep research starts
- `research/research.md` as the canonical report with at least 5 evidence-backed findings
- explicit comparison between Mex and current `Code_Environment/Public` documentation/memory validation capabilities

## Assessment
- New information ratio: 0.44

## Recommended Next Focus
Design a concrete retrieval policy matrix for Spec Kit Memory with four explicit outcomes: `lexical-first`, `semantic-first`, `hybrid-balanced`, and `graph-first`. Tie each mode to query classes, required result attribution, degradation behavior, and eval queries so we can prove when BM25/FTS should dominate, when embeddings should dominate, and when Mex-style static drift checks should run as a separate integrity layer rather than inside the recall stack.

- **Source**: [external/src/cli.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/src/cli.ts#L8), [external/src/config.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/src/config.ts#L9), [mcp_server/README.md](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/README.md#L557), [mcp_server/README.md](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/README.md#L1531), [mcp_server/context-server.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/context-server.ts#L684)
- **What it does**: Mex keeps the public surface to a few verbs: `setup`, `check`, `sync`, `init`, `pattern add`, `watch`, `commands`. It also fails crisply when you are inside `.mex`, when the scaffold is incomplete, or when there is no git repo. The `commands` subcommand doubles as a built-in cheat sheet.
- **Why it matters**: Spec Kit is more powerful, but its DX cost is real: 47 tools, multiple recovery surfaces, several maintenance tools, and separate scripts. We already partially compensate with `memory_context`, `session_bootstrap`, common-pattern docs, troubleshooting, and response hints, but Mex’s smaller surface is easier to teach, remember, and debug.
- **Recommendation**: adopt now
- **Impact**: high

## Assessment
- New information ratio: 0.42

## Recommended Next Focus
Define a concrete `spec-kit doctor` DX surface that maps existing capabilities into one guided flow: `bootstrap -> diagnose -> repair suggestion -> optional auto-repair -> recheck -> next call hints`. The highest-value follow-up is to design that command contract around current tools we already have: `session_bootstrap`, `memory_health`, `memory_save(dryRun)`, `code_graph_scan`, `memory_index_scan`, and trace-enabled retrieval responses.

- **What it does**: Mex extracts typed markdown claims from inline code, code blocks, and dependency headings, then runs zero-token checks for missing paths, dead frontmatter edges, and `patterns/INDEX.md` drift. It already distinguishes real missing references from pattern/template placeholders by downgrading some path misses to warnings.
- **Why it matters for us**: This cleanly maps to our real gap. Spec Kit already has semantic retrieval, trigger recall, causal links, and health tooling, but it does not statically verify that markdown references still point to real files or that pattern indexes stay in sync.
- **Recommendation**: adopt now
- **Impact**: high

RESEARCH BRIEF:
# $refine TIDD-EC Prompt: 002-mex-main

## 2. Role

You are a research specialist in knowledge scaffold architectures, drift detection systems, markdown-based persistence, and codebase-knowledge synchronization. Work like a systems analyst who can separate scaffold design, static drift checking, and targeted AI repair loops, then translate Mex's concrete mechanisms into practical improvements for `Code_Environment/Public`.

## 3. Task

Research Mex's markdown scaffold and drift detection patterns to identify practical, evidence-backed improvements for `Code_Environment/Public`, especially around staleness detection, codebase-knowledge synchronization, and structured project knowledge. Determine which Mex patterns should be `adopt now`, `prototype later`, or `reject`.

## 4. Context

### 4.1 System Description

Mex is a structured markdown scaffold with a TypeScript/Node.js CLI for persistent AI project memory. Instead of a database, it keeps project knowledge in navigable markdown files such as `AGENTS.md`, `ROUTER.md`, `context/*.md`, and `patterns/*.md`. Its defining mechanism is drift detection: eight static checkers validate scaffold claims against the real codebase without AI or token spend. Those checkers cover path validation, frontmatter edges, pattern index consistency, staleness based on git history, command existence, dependency claims, cross-file contradictions, and script coverage. Drift starts at score `100` and deducts `-10` per error, `-3` per warning, and `-1` per info. The scaffold is designed to grow after real work through pattern creation, targeted context updates, and current-state refreshes rather than one-time setup alone.

### 4.2 Cross-Phase Awareness Table

| Phase | System | Core Pattern | Overlap Risk | Differentiation |
|-------|--------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|
| 001 | Engram | MCP memory server (Go, SQLite+FTS5) | 002 (memory persistence) | Focus tool profiles, session lifecycle, topic keys |
| 002 | Mex | Markdown scaffold + drift detection | 001 (memory), 003 (memory) | Focus drift detection, scaffold structure, no-DB approach |
| 003 | Modus Memory | FSRS spaced repetition + BM25 | 001 (FTS5), 004 (local memory) | Focus FSRS decay, cross-referencing, librarian expansion |
| 004 | OpenCode Mnemosyne | Hybrid search (FTS5 + vector) | 001 (FTS5), 003 (local memory) | Focus vector search, plugin architecture, scoping |

### 4.3 What This Repo Already Has

`Code_Environment/Public` already has Spec Kit validation via `validate.sh` with severity-oriented checks, indexed memory files with frontmatter, and a `MEMORY.md`-style documentation/memory model. What it does **not** currently have is an automated drift checker that compares documentation or memory scaffolds against the actual filesystem, commands, dependencies, git staleness, or cross-file contradictions. Research should stay centered on that gap rather than re-covering general memory persistence already addressed by phase `001`.

## 5. Instructions

1. Treat `/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main` as the pre-approved phase folder. Skip Gate 3, keep all writes inside this phase folder, and treat everything under `external/` as read-only.
2. Start with `external/mex-main/README.md`. Read the positioning, the eight-checker summary, the drift-score model, the command surface, and the documented file structure before inferring anything from implementation details.
3. Immediately after the README, inspect the scaffold contract files in this order: `external/mex-main/AGENTS.md`, `external/mex-main/ROUTER.md`, `external/mex-main/SETUP.md`, and `external/mex-main/SYNC.md`. Treat these as the canonical markdown scaffold, growth loop, and resync workflow.
4. Map the scaffold structure explicitly: project-root tool instruction file, scaffold root, `context/` files, `patterns/INDEX.md`, pattern files, and the GROW step that updates project state and creates new patterns from real work.
5. Read `external/mex-main/src/cli.ts` next. Trace the user-facing layers in order: `mex init`, `mex check`, `mex sync`, `mex pattern add`, `mex watch`, and `mex commands`. Use this to anchor later claims about the relationship between setup, drift detection, targeted sync, and scaffold growth.
6. Read `external/mex-main/src/drift/index.ts`, `src/drift/claims.ts`, `src/drift/frontmatter.ts`, and `src/drift/scoring.ts`. Understand how Mex finds scaffold files, extracts claims from markdown, parses frontmatter edges, runs checker passes, and computes the final drift score.
7. Read `external/mex-main/src/scanner/index.ts` plus the scanner modules it composes. Focus on how Mex builds a structured brief first, then instructs AI to populate scaffold files from that brief rather than from raw exploratory browsing.
8. Read `external/mex-main/src/sync/brief-builder.ts` and `src/pattern/index.ts`. Study how Mex turns drift issues into targeted repair prompts, supplies filesystem and git context, and appends new patterns into the scaffold instead of treating documentation as static.
9. Examine the first three drift checkers individually: `src/drift/checkers/path.ts`, `src/drift/checkers/edges.ts`, and `src/drift/checkers/index-sync.ts`. Document the actual detection logic, severity behavior, placeholder handling, and what kind of documentation drift each checker catches.
10. Examine the next three drift checkers individually: `src/drift/checkers/staleness.ts`, `src/drift/checkers/command.ts`, and `src/drift/checkers/dependency.ts`. Capture the exact thresholds and matching rules, including how staleness uses both days and commit counts, how commands are validated, and how dependency claims are compared to manifests.
11. Examine the final two drift checkers individually: `src/drift/checkers/cross-file.ts` and `src/drift/checkers/script-coverage.ts`. Explain how Mex detects contradictions across scaffold files and how it checks whether real scripts are missing from the scaffold narrative.
12. Compare Mex directly against current `Code_Environment/Public` capabilities: Spec Kit validation, memory frontmatter, documented memory/index structure, and other repo guidance files. Be precise about where Mex adds new capability versus where it overlaps with systems already covered by phases `001`, `003`, or `004`.
13. Before any deep-research run, ensure this phase folder contains the expected spec-kit docs for the chosen level. Validate the phase folder with:
    ```bash
    cd /Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public && bash .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/spec/validate.sh "/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main" --strict
    ```
14. After validation passes, run deep research using this exact topic:
    ```text
    Research the external repository at /Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/mex-main and identify concrete improvements for Code_Environment/Public, especially around knowledge scaffold design, drift detection, staleness checking, codebase-knowledge synchronization, and structured project memory.
    ```
15. Save all outputs inside this phase folder, especially under `research/`. Every finding must cite exact file paths, describe what Mex actually does, why it matters for `Code_Environment/Public`, whether it should be `adopt now`, `prototype later`, or `reject`, what subsystem it would affect, and what migration or validation risk comes with it. When research is complete, update `checklist.md`, create `implementation-summary.md`, and save memory with:
    ```bash
    cd /Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public && node .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/dist/memory/generate-context.js "/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main"
    ```

## 6. Research Questions

1. How does Mex's markdown-first scaffold change the tradeoff between navigability, editability, and correctness compared with database-backed memory systems?
2. How do the eight drift checkers compose into a practical health model, and where are the blind spots between checker coverage and actual scaffold truthfulness?
3. Are Mex's staleness thresholds (`30` warning days, `90` error days, `50` warning commits, `200` error commits) reasonable defaults, and how might similar thresholds be calibrated for `Code_Environment/Public`?
4. What makes Mex's path, edge, and index-sync checks useful as low-cost documentation integrity guards, and which of those ideas translate cleanly into Spec Kit?
5. How effective is the scoring model (`100 - 10/error - 3/warning - 1/info`) as a developer-facing health metric, and would `Code_Environment/Public` benefit from a comparable score or from severity-only reporting?
6. How does Mex's claim extraction model work in practice, especially its distinction between paths, commands, dependencies, and versions pulled from markdown?
7. What does Mex gain by checking real scripts that are undocumented in the scaffold, and how does that differ from existing `validate.sh` checks in this repo?
8. How does Mex's targeted sync flow convert static drift findings into precise AI repair prompts, and could `Code_Environment/Public` adopt a similar "fix only what's broken" pattern?
9. How do Mex's GROW rules and `pattern add` workflow support scaffold auto-growth after tasks rather than only during initialization?
10. What are the strongest arguments for keeping some project knowledge in markdown even when richer search or database systems exist elsewhere in the stack?

## 7. Do's

- Do examine each of the eight drift checkers individually rather than relying on the README summary alone.
- Do study the scoring algorithm and relate score behavior to developer incentives and operational clarity.
- Do analyze how scaffold growth happens after tasks through GROW rules, `pattern add`, targeted sync, and current-state updates.
- Do compare Mex's drift logic directly against `Code_Environment/Public` validation and memory/documentation surfaces.
- Do separate static drift detection from AI-assisted repair; they are distinct layers in Mex.
- Do highlight which Mex ideas help codebase-knowledge synchronization without requiring a database.
- Do address overlap with phase `001` explicitly so this phase stays focused on drift detection and scaffold design rather than generic persistence.

## 8. Don'ts

- Do not focus the research on npm packaging, build tooling, or release mechanics.
- Do not dismiss the markdown approach as primitive; markdown is the core persistence decision under evaluation.
- Do not confuse drift detection with AI-based validation or sync; the checkers are zero-token static analysis.
- Do not let README prose overrule source evidence from `src/`.
- Do not recommend importing Mex wholesale if the reusable value is only a subset of its design.
- Do not collapse this phase into memory-persistence comparisons already owned by phase `001`.
- Do not edit anything under `external/` or outside this phase folder.

## 9. Examples

### Example A: Staleness-checking finding

`src/drift/checkers/staleness.ts` does not rely on human judgment alone; it flags scaffold files by both elapsed days and commits since last change. A strong finding would explain why combining temporal and repository-activity signals is stronger than date-only freshness, show how that could improve Public's documentation hygiene, and classify the idea as `adopt now`, `prototype later`, or `reject`.

### Example B: Drift-detection composition finding

Mex does not use one monolithic "docs are wrong" check. `path.ts`, `edges.ts`, `index-sync.ts`, `command.ts`, `dependency.ts`, `cross-file.ts`, and `script-coverage.ts` each catch a different failure mode. A strong finding would describe how those checks work together, identify which subset would most improve `Code_Environment/Public`, and explain where Spec Kit validation already covers adjacent concerns.

## 10. Constraints

### 10.1 Error handling

- If a README claim cannot be verified in `src/`, mark it as unverified instead of repeating it as fact.
- If a checker behaves differently from the README summary, prefer the source code and call out the discrepancy explicitly.
- If a file path inside the external repo is missing, say so plainly and continue with the remaining evidence rather than guessing.
- If the external repo structure changes from the paths named here, adjust the reading path but preserve the same analytical order.

### 10.2 Scope

**IN SCOPE**

- scaffold structure and navigation model
- markdown persistence design
- all eight drift checkers
- scoring and health reporting
- staleness thresholds and git-based freshness signals
- targeted sync prompt generation
- scaffold auto-growth and pattern creation
- comparison with `Code_Environment/Public` validation and memory surfaces

    22	---
    23	
    24	AI agents forget everything between sessions. mex gives them permanent, navigable project memory.
    25	
    26	Every session starts cold:
    27	
    28	- The agent has **no idea** what it built yesterday
    29	- It forgets the conventions you agreed on
    30	- It doesn't know what broke last week
    31	
    32	Developers compensate by stuffing everything into CLAUDE.md — but that floods the context window, burns tokens, and degrades attention. Meanwhile, the project changes and nobody updates the docs. The agent's understanding drifts from reality.
    33	
    34	mex is a structured markdown scaffold with a CLI that keeps it honest. The scaffold gives agents persistent project knowledge through navigable files — architecture, conventions, decisions, patterns. The CLI detects when those files drift from the actual codebase, and targets AI to fix only what's broken. The scaffold grows automatically — after every task, the agent updates project state and creates patterns from real work.
    35	
    36	Works with any stack — JavaScript, Python, Go, Rust, and more.

    38	## Star History
    39	
    40	[![Star History Chart](https://api.star-history.com/svg?repos=theDakshJaitly/mex&type=Timeline)](https://star-history.com/#theDakshJaitly/mex&Timeline)
    41	
    42	## Install
    43	
    44	The npm package is named `promexeus` (our social handle — `mex` was taken on npm). The CLI command is `mex`.
    45	
    46	```bash
    47	npx promexeus setup
    48	```
    49	
    50	That's it. The setup command creates the `.mex/` scaffold, asks which AI tool you use, pre-scans your codebase, and generates a targeted prompt to populate everything. Takes about 5 minutes.
    51	
    52	At the end of setup, you'll be asked to install mex globally. If you accept:
    53	
    54	```bash
    55	mex check        # drift score
    56	mex sync         # fix drift
    57	```
    58	
    59	If you skip global install, everything still works via npx:
    60	
    61	```bash
    62	npx promexeus check        # drift score
    63	npx promexeus sync         # fix drift
    64	```
    65	
    66	You can install globally later at any time:
    67	
    68	```bash
    69	npm install -g promexeus
    70	```
    71	
    72	## Drift Detection
    73	
    74	Eight checkers validate your scaffold against the real codebase. Zero tokens, zero AI.
    75	
    76	| Checker | What it catches |
    77	|---------|----------------|
    78	| **path** | Referenced file paths that don't exist on disk |
    79	| **edges** | YAML frontmatter edge targets pointing to missing files |
    80	| **index-sync** | `patterns/INDEX.md` out of sync with actual pattern files |
    81	| **staleness** | Scaffold files not updated in 30+ days or 50+ commits |
    82	| **command** | `npm run X` / `make X` referencing scripts that don't exist |
    83	| **dependency** | Claimed dependencies missing from `package.json` |
    84	| **cross-file** | Same dependency with different versions across files |
    85	| **script-coverage** | `package.json` scripts not mentioned in any scaffold file |
    86	
    87	Scoring: starts at 100. Deducts -10 per error, -3 per warning, -1 per info.
    88	
    89	<!-- TODO: Add screenshot of `mex check` terminal output here -->
    90	![mex check output](screenshots/mex-check.jpg) 
    91	
    92	## CLI
    93	
    94	All commands run from your **project root**. If you didn't install globally, replace `mex` with `npx promexeus`.
    95	
    96	### Commands
    97	
    98	| Command | What it does |
    99	|---------|-------------|
   100	| `mex setup` | First-time setup — create `.mex/` scaffold and populate with AI |
   101	| `mex setup --dry-run` | Preview what setup would do without making changes |
   102	| `mex check` | Run all 8 checkers, output drift score and issues |
   103	| `mex check --quiet` | One-liner: `mex: drift score 92/100 (1 warning)` |
   104	| `mex check --json` | Full report as JSON for programmatic use |
   105	| `mex check --fix` | Check and jump straight to sync if errors found |
   106	| `mex sync` | Detect drift → choose mode → AI fixes → verify → repeat |
   107	| `mex sync --dry-run` | Preview targeted prompts without executing |
   108	| `mex sync --warnings` | Include warning-only files in sync |
   109	| `mex init` | Pre-scan codebase, build structured brief for AI |
   110	| `mex init --json` | Raw scanner brief as JSON |
   111	| `mex watch` | Install post-commit hook (silent on perfect score) |
   112	| `mex watch --uninstall` | Remove the hook |
   113	| `mex commands` | List all commands and scripts with descriptions |
   114

   124	Real output from testing mex on Agrow, an AI-powered agricultural voice helpline (Python/Flask, Twilio, multi-provider pipeline).
   125	
   126	**Scaffold before setup:**
   127	```markdown
   128	## Current Project State
   129	<!-- What is working. What is not yet built. Known issues.
   130	     Update this section whenever significant work is completed. -->
   131	```
   132	
   133	**Scaffold after setup:**
   134	```markdown
   135	## Current Project State
   136	
   137	**Working:**
   138	- Voice call pipeline (Twilio → STT → LLM → TTS → response)
   139	- Multi-provider STT (ElevenLabs, Deepgram) with configurable selection
   140	- RAG system with Supabase pgvector for agricultural knowledge retrieval
   141	- Streaming pipeline with barge-in support
   142	
   143	**Not yet built:**
   144	- Admin dashboard for call monitoring
   145	- Automated test suite
   146	- Multi-turn conversation memory across calls
   147	
   148	**Known issues:**
   149	- Sarvam AI STT bypass active — routing to ElevenLabs as fallback
   150	```
   151	
   152	**Patterns directory after setup:**
   153	```

   159	```
   160	
   161	## Real World Results
   162	
   163	Independently tested by a community member on **OpenClaw** across 10 structured scenarios on a homelab setup (Ubuntu 24.04, Kubernetes, Docker, Ansible, Terraform, networking, monitoring). 10/10 tests passed. Drift score: 100/100.
   164	
   165	**Token usage before vs after mex:**
   166	
   167	| Scenario | Without mex | With mex | Saved |
   168	|----------|------------|---------|-------|
   169	| "How does K8s work?" | ~3,300 tokens | ~1,450 tokens | 56% |
   170	| "Open UFW port" | ~3,300 tokens | ~1,050 tokens | 68% |
   171	| "Explain Docker" | ~3,300 tokens | ~1,100 tokens | 67% |
   172	| Multi-context query | ~3,300 tokens | ~1,650 tokens | 50% |
   173	
   174	**~60% average token reduction per session.**
   175	
   176	Context is no longer all-or-nothing — loaded on demand, only what's relevant.
   177	
   178	## How It Works
   179	
   180	```
   181	Session starts
   182	    ↓
   183	Agent loads CLAUDE.md (auto-loaded, lives at project root)
   184	    ↓
   185	CLAUDE.md says "Read .mex/ROUTER.md before doing anything"
   186	    ↓
   187	ROUTER.md routing table → loads relevant context file for this task
   188	    ↓
   189	context file → points to pattern file if task-specific guidance exists
   190	    ↓
   191	Agent executes with full project context, minimal token cost
   192	    ↓
   193	After task: agent updates scaffold (GROW step)
   194	    ↓
   195	New patterns, updated project state — scaffold grows from real work
   196	```
   197	
   198	CLAUDE.md stays at ~120 tokens. The agent navigates to only what it needs. After every task, the agent updates the scaffold — creating patterns from new task types, updating project state, fixing stale context. The scaffold compounds over time.
   199

/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/handlers/save/README.md:27:`handlers/save/` contains the decomposed pipeline for the `memory_save` MCP tool. Each file owns a single stage of the save flow, from deduplication through embedding generation, save quality gating, prediction-error gating, reconsolidation, record creation, post-insert enrichment, and final response assembly.

    30	### Finding 1: Static markdown reference integrity is the only clear adopt-now slice

    32	- **What it does**: Mex extracts typed markdown claims from inline code, code blocks, and dependency headings, then runs zero-token checks for missing paths, dead frontmatter edges, and `patterns/INDEX.md` drift. It already distinguishes real missing references from pattern/template placeholders by downgrading some path misses to warnings.
    33	- **Why it matters for us**: This cleanly maps to our real gap. Spec Kit already has semantic retrieval, trigger recall, causal links, and health tooling, but it does not statically verify that markdown references still point to real files or that pattern indexes stay in sync.
    34	- **Recommendation**: adopt now
    35	- **Impact**: high
    36	--- Iteration 21 ---
    37	- **Why it matters**: This is excellent DX because the tool never traps the developer inside opaque automation. Spec Kit already has rich traces and dry-run save validation, but it lacks a similarly unified “show me the exact repair bundle” experience for memory repair, readiness recovery, or save troubleshooting.
    38	- **Recommendation**: adopt now
    39	- **Impact**: high
    40	
    41	### Finding 3: Mex’s detect-fix-verify loop is a stronger maintenance workflow than our current toolbox-style repair model
    42	- **Source**: [external/README.md](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/README.md#L102), [external/src/sync/index.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/src/sync/index.ts#L29), [external/src/reporter.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/src/reporter.ts#L16), [mcp_server/README.md](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/README.md#L763)
    43	- **What it does**: `mex sync` runs drift detection, narrows to the right files, offers interactive or prompt mode, executes a repair pass, reruns drift detection, prints score delta, and loops until the user stops or the score reaches the target. The workflow is centered on closure, not just diagnosis.
    44	- **Why it matters**: Spec Kit has the ingredients, not the same developer flow. We expose `memory_health`, `memory_index_scan`, `code_graph_scan`, `session_bootstrap`, save dry-runs, and traces, but developers still need to know which tool to call next and in what order. Mex’s loop is the DX pattern to steal: a guided “doctor/repair” command that owns diagnosis, repair suggestions, rerun, and stop conditions.
    45	- **Recommendation**: NEW FEATURE
    46	- **Impact**: high
    47	
    48	### Finding 4: Mex’s low-noise post-commit hook is a good hygiene pattern because it only interrupts on failure
    49	- **Source**: [external/README.md](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/README.md#L111), [external/src/watch.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/src/watch.ts#L8), [mcp_server/README.md](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/README.md#L497)
    50	- **What it does**: `mex watch` installs a post-commit hook that runs `check --quiet` and prints nothing on a perfect score. The hook is additive, marker-based, and removable without clobbering unrelated hook logic.
    51	- **Why it matters**: Spec Kit already has filesystem watching for index maintenance, but that is infrastructure behavior, not developer-facing feedback. Mex shows a better DX pattern for background hygiene: silent when healthy, visible only when action is needed. That would fit nicely for optional local reminders about stale graph state, broken save quality, or degraded memory health.
    52	- **Recommendation**: prototype later
    53	- **Impact**: medium
    54	
    55	### Finding 5: Mex wins on command discoverability because it exposes a tiny, memorable verb set with sharp error messages
    56	- **Source**: [external/src/cli.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/src/cli.ts#L8), [external/src/config.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/src/config.ts#L9), [mcp_server/README.md](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/README.md#L557), [mcp_server/README.md](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/README.md#L1531), [mcp_server/context-server.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/context-server.ts#L684)
    57	- **What it does**: Mex keeps the public surface to a few verbs: `setup`, `check`, `sync`, `init`, `pattern add`, `watch`, `commands`. It also fails crisply when you are inside `.mex`, when the scaffold is incomplete, or when there is no git repo. The `commands` subcommand doubles as a built-in cheat sheet.
    58	- **Why it matters**: Spec Kit is more powerful, but its DX cost is real: 47 tools, multiple recovery surfaces, several maintenance tools, and separate scripts. We already partially compensate with `memory_context`, `session_bootstrap`, common-pattern docs, troubleshooting, and response hints, but Mex’s smaller surface is easier to teach, remember, and debug.
    59	- **Recommendation**: adopt now
    60	- **Impact**: high
    61	
    62	## Assessment
    63	- New information ratio: 0.42
    64	
    65	## Recommended Next Focus
    66	Define a concrete `spec-kit doctor` DX surface that maps existing capabilities into one guided flow: `bootstrap -> diagnose -> repair suggestion -> optional auto-repair -> recheck -> next call hints`. The highest-value follow-up is to design that command contract around current tools we already have: `session_bootstrap`, `memory_health`, `memory_save(dryRun)`, `code_graph_scan`, `memory_index_scan`, and trace-enabled retrieval responses.

    80	## Assessment
  6180	### Finding 1: Mex chose a tiny always-loaded anchor plus explicit routing into modular markdown context
  6181	- **Source**: [mex README](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/README.md#L178), [AGENTS.md](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/AGENTS.md#L37), [ROUTER.md](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/ROUTER.md#L43)
  6182	- **What it does**: Mex keeps the root prompt tiny, then routes sessions into `context/*` and `patterns/*`, with a fixed `CONTEXT -> BUILD -> VERIFY -> DEBUG -> GROW` behavior loop.
  6183	- **Why it matters**: This is a strong human-auditable documentation pattern, but for us it fits best as a companion docs layer, not as a replacement for `memory_context`, `session_bootstrap`, CocoIndex, or code-graph routing.
  6184	- **Recommendation**: prototype later
  6185	- **Impact**: medium
  6186	
  6187	### Finding 2: Mex deliberately separates zero-token integrity checks from AI repair
  6188	- **Source**: [mex README](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/README.md#L72), [drift/index.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/src/drift/index.ts#L17), [path.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/src/drift/checkers/path.ts#L8), [edges.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/src/drift/checkers/edges.ts#L5), [index-sync.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/src/drift/checkers/index-sync.ts#L6)
  6189	- **What it does**: `runDriftCheck()` extracts claims and frontmatter from scaffold files, runs static checkers, and computes integrity issues before any AI fix step is considered.
  6190	- **Why it matters**: This is the cleanest adopt-now decision. Spec Kit Memory already has strong retrieval and graph readiness, but it still lacks a separate markdown integrity layer for dead paths, dead edges, and pattern-index drift.
  6191	- **Recommendation**: adopt now
  6192	- **Impact**: high
  6193	
  6194	### Finding 3: Mex uses markdown files as the primary persistence substrate for project memory
  6195	- **Source**: [mex README](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/README.md#L24), [mex README](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/README.md#L200), [Spec Kit README](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/README.md#L45), [Spec Kit README](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/README.md#L223), [Spec Kit README](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/README.md#L996), [Spec Kit README](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/README.md#L1060)
  6196	- **What it does**: Mex treats navigable markdown as the long-lived memory store, with CLI tooling keeping those files aligned to the repo.
  6197	- **Why it matters**: We should reject this as a core replacement for Spec Kit Memory. It would be a regression versus our database-backed hybrid retrieval, causal links, session dedup, and structural code-graph queries.
  6198	- **Recommendation**: reject
  6199	- **Impact**: high
  6200	
  6201	### Finding 4: Mex builds a structured scanner brief before asking AI to populate or reason about the scaffold
  6202	- **Source**: [mex README](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/README.md#L50), [SETUP.md](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/SETUP.md#L13), [scanner/index.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/src/scanner/index.ts#L8)
  6203	- **What it does**: `mex init` scans manifests, entry points, folder tree, tooling, and README, then tells the AI to populate from that brief instead of freeform repo exploration.
  6204	- **Why it matters**: This is a good pattern for our spec/changelog/doc generation workflows because it makes AI inputs smaller and auditable, but it is not a recall-path improvement by itself.
  6205	- **Recommendation**: prototype later
  6206	- **Impact**: medium
  6207	
  6208	### Finding 5: Mex’s core maintenance loop is detect -> build file-scoped repair brief -> fix -> recheck -> repeat
  6209	- **Source**: [mex README](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/README.md#L96), [SYNC.md](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/SYNC.md#L9), [sync/index.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/src/sync/index.ts#L29), [brief-builder.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/src/sync/brief-builder.ts#L18)
  6210	- **What it does**: Mex groups issues by file, includes current file content plus filesystem and git context, runs one repair session, then measures score delta and optionally loops again.
  6211	- **Why it matters**: This is the strongest reusable DX decision. Spec Kit has the primitives already, but not a single guided “doctor/repair” loop that owns diagnosis, suggested fix path, rerun, and stop conditions.
  6212	- **Recommendation**: NEW FEATURE
  6213	- **Impact**: high

  6217	- **What it does**: After work, Mex wants new task patterns added, stale context surgically updated, and old decisions preserved instead of overwritten.
  6218	- **Why it matters**: We already preserve session context and can model causal lineage, but we do not yet have an equally explicit project-pattern growth loop. That is useful, especially for repeatable operational playbooks, but it should remain secondary to indexed memory.
  6219	- **Recommendation**: prototype later

  6224	- **What it does**: Health is `100 - 10/error - 3/warning - 1/info`, with staleness thresholds of 30/90 days and 50/200 commits, then rendered as a single drift score.
  6225	- **Why it matters**: This is good UX for a small scaffold, but it is too lossy for Spec Kit Memory. Our system needs subsystem-specific evidence and eval-backed thresholds, not one blended score that hides whether the problem is retrieval quality, graph freshness, or markdown integrity.
  6226	- **Recommendation**: reject

  6233	Design the Spec Kit policy split explicitly: keep Mex-style static drift as a separate integrity layer, not part of recall, then define the retrieval policy matrix with four outcomes: `lexical-first`, `semantic-first`, `hybrid-balanced`, and `graph-first`, plus when a future `spec-kit doctor` facade should invoke each path.

  6243	## Findings
  6244	### Finding 1: Mex chose a tiny always-loaded anchor plus explicit routing into modular markdown context
  6245	- **Source**: [mex README](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/README.md#L178), [AGENTS.md](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/AGENTS.md#L37), [ROUTER.md](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/ROUTER.md#L43)
  6246	- **What it does**: Mex keeps the root prompt tiny, then routes sessions into `context/*` and `patterns/*`, with a fixed `CONTEXT -> BUILD -> VERIFY -> DEBUG -> GROW` behavior loop.
  6247	- **Why it matters**: This is a strong human-auditable documentation pattern, but for us it fits best as a companion docs layer, not as a replacement for `memory_context`, `session_bootstrap`, CocoIndex, or code-graph routing.
  6248	- **Recommendation**: prototype later
  6249	- **Impact**: medium
  6250	
  6251	### Finding 2: Mex deliberately separates zero-token integrity checks from AI repair
  6252	- **Source**: [mex README](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/README.md#L72), [drift/index.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/src/drift/index.ts#L17), [path.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/src/drift/checkers/path.ts#L8), [edges.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/src/drift/checkers/edges.ts#L5), [index-sync.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/src/drift/checkers/index-sync.ts#L6)
  6253	- **What it does**: `runDriftCheck()` extracts claims and frontmatter from scaffold files, runs static checkers, and computes integrity issues before any AI fix step is considered.
  6254	- **Why it matters**: This is the cleanest adopt-now decision. Spec Kit Memory already has strong retrieval and graph readiness, but it still lacks a separate markdown integrity layer for dead paths, dead edges, and pattern-index drift.
  6255	- **Recommendation**: adopt now
  6256	- **Impact**: high
  6257	
  6258	### Finding 3: Mex uses markdown files as the primary persistence substrate for project memory
  6259	- **Source**: [mex README](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/README.md#L24), [mex README](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/README.md#L200), [Spec Kit README](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/README.md#L45), [Spec Kit README](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/README.md#L223), [Spec Kit README](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/README.md#L996), [Spec Kit README](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/README.md#L1060)
  6260	- **What it does**: Mex treats navigable markdown as the long-lived memory store, with CLI tooling keeping those files aligned to the repo.
  6261	- **Why it matters**: We should reject this as a core replacement for Spec Kit Memory. It would be a regression versus our database-backed hybrid retrieval, causal links, session dedup, and structural code-graph queries.
  6262	- **Recommendation**: reject
  6263	- **Impact**: high
  6264	
  6265	### Finding 4: Mex builds a structured scanner brief before asking AI to populate or reason about the scaffold
  6266	- **Source**: [mex README](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/README.md#L50), [SETUP.md](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/SETUP.md#L13), [scanner/index.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/src/scanner/index.ts#L8)
  6267	- **What it does**: `mex init` scans manifests, entry points, folder tree, tooling, and README, then tells the AI to populate from that brief instead of freeform repo exploration.
  6268	- **Why it matters**: This is a good pattern for our spec/changelog/doc generation workflows because it makes AI inputs smaller and auditable, but it is not a recall-path improvement by itself.
  6269	- **Recommendation**: prototype later
  6270	- **Impact**: medium
  6271	
  6272	### Finding 5: Mex’s core maintenance loop is detect -> build file-scoped repair brief -> fix -> recheck -> repeat
  6273	- **Source**: [mex README](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/README.md#L96), [SYNC.md](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/SYNC.md#L9), [sync/index.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/src/sync/index.ts#L29), [brief-builder.ts](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/src/sync/brief-builder.ts#L18)
  6274	- **What it does**: Mex groups issues by file, includes current file content plus filesystem and git context, runs one repair session, then measures score delta and optionally loops again.
  6275	- **Why it matters**: This is the strongest reusable DX decision. Spec Kit has the primitives already, but not a single guided “doctor/repair” loop that owns diagnosis, suggested fix path, rerun, and stop conditions.
  6276	- **Recommendation**: NEW FEATURE
  6277	- **Impact**: high
  6278	
  6279	### Finding 6: Mex grows its knowledge base from completed work through patterns and append-only decisions

I’ve got enough to lock the recommendation tiers now. I’m doing one last targeted pass on the claim extraction and low-cost integrity checkers, since those are the main adopt-now candidates and I want their behavior stated precisely.

    38	After every task: if no pattern exists for the task type you just completed, create one. If a pattern or context file is now out of date, update it. The scaffold grows from real work, not just setup. See the GROW step in `ROUTER.md` for details.
    39	
    40	## Navigation
    41	At the start of every session, read `ROUTER.md` before doing anything else.
    42	For full project context, patterns, and task guidance — everything is there.

    43	## Routing Table
    44	
    45	Load the relevant file based on the current task. Always load `context/architecture.md` first if not already in context this session.
    46	
    47	| Task type | Load |
    48	|-----------|------|
    49	| Understanding how the system works | `context/architecture.md` |
    50	| Working with a specific technology | `context/stack.md` |
    51	| Writing or reviewing code | `context/conventions.md` |
    52	| Making a design decision | `context/decisions.md` |
    53	| Setting up or running the project | `context/setup.md` |
    54	| Any specific task | Check `patterns/INDEX.md` for a matching pattern |
    55	
    56	## Behavioural Contract
    57	
    58	For every task, follow this loop:
    59	
    60	1. **CONTEXT** — Load the relevant context file(s) from the routing table above. Check `patterns/INDEX.md` for a matching pattern. If one exists, follow it. Narrate what you load: "Loading architecture context..."
    61	2. **BUILD** — Do the work. If a pattern exists, follow its Steps. If you are about to deviate from an established pattern, say so before writing any code — state the deviation and why.
    62	3. **VERIFY** — Load `context/conventions.md` and run the Verify Checklist item by item. State each item and whether the output passes. Do not summarise — enumerate explicitly.
    63	4. **DEBUG** — If verification fails or something breaks, check `patterns/INDEX.md` for a debug pattern. Follow it. Fix the issue and re-run VERIFY.
    64	5. **GROW** — After completing the task:
    65	   - If no pattern exists for this task type, create one in `patterns/` using the format in `patterns/README.md`. Add it to `patterns/INDEX.md`. Flag it: "Created `patterns/<name>.md` from this session."
    66	   - If a pattern exists but you deviated from it or discovered a new gotcha, update it with what you learned.
    67	   - If any `context/` file is now out of date because of this work, update it surgically — do not rewrite entire files.
    68	   - Update the "Current Project State" section above if the work was significant.

     7	```
     8	
     9	The script runs drift detection first, shows you exactly what's wrong, then offers:
    10	1. **Targeted sync** — AI fixes only the flagged files (fastest, cheapest)
    11	2. **Full resync** — AI re-reads everything and updates all scaffold files
    12	3. **Prompt export** — shows the prompts for manual paste

    20	mex sync --dry-run     # preview targeted fix prompts
    21	```
    22	
    23	## Manual Resync
    24	
    25	If you prefer to paste a prompt manually, or don't have the CLI built:
    26	
    27	---
    28	
    29	**SYNC PROMPT — copy everything between the lines:**
    30	
    31	```
    32	You are going to resync the AI context scaffold for this project.
    33	The scaffold may be out of date — the codebase has changed since it was last populated.
    34	
    35	First, read all files in context/ to understand the current scaffold state.
    36	Then explore what has changed in the codebase since the scaffold was last updated.
    37	Check the last_updated dates in the YAML frontmatter of each file.
    38	
    39	For each context/ file:
    40	1. Compare the current scaffold content to the actual codebase
    41	2. Identify what has changed, been added, or been removed
    42	3. Update the file to reflect the current state
    43	
    44	Critical rules for updating:
    45	- Use surgical, targeted edits — NOT full file rewrites. Read the existing content,
    46	  identify what changed, and update only those sections.
    47	- PRESERVE YAML frontmatter structure. Never delete or rewrite the entire frontmatter block.
    48	  Edit individual fields only. The edges, triggers, name, and description fields must
    49	  survive every sync. If you need to update edges, add or remove individual entries —
    50	  do not replace the entire array.
    51	- In context/decisions.md: NEVER delete existing decisions.
    52	  If a decision has changed, mark the old entry as "Superseded by [new decision title]"
    53	  and add the new decision above it with today's date.
    54	- In all other files: update content to reflect current reality
    55	- Update last_updated in the YAML frontmatter of every file you change
    56	- After updating each file, update ROUTER.md Current Project State
    57	
    58	When done, report:
    59	- Which files were updated and what changed
    60	- Any decisions that were superseded
    61	- Any slots that could not be filled with confidence
    62	```

I’ve finished the evidence pass. The main blocker now is environmental, not analytical: this session is read-only, so I can deliver the definitive iteration-30 synthesis but I can’t write it back into `research/research.md`, `implementation-summary.md`, or phase checklist files from here.

# Iteration 030: FINAL EXTENDED SYNTHESIS

## Focus
FINAL EXTENDED SYNTHESIS: integrate iterations 1-29, lock the recommendation tiers, and turn the Mex research into one definitive decision set for Spec Kit Memory.

## Findings
### Finding 1: Add a separate markdown integrity lane for dead references and index drift
- **Source**: [README.md:72](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/README.md), [claims.ts:37](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/src/drift/claims.ts), [path.ts:8](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/src/drift/checkers/path.ts), [edges.ts:5](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/src/drift/checkers/edges.ts), [index-sync.ts:6](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/src/drift/checkers/index-sync.ts)
- **What it does**: Mex extracts typed claims from markdown, then statically checks missing paths, dead frontmatter edges, and `patterns/INDEX.md` drift before any AI repair.
- **Why it matters**: This is the clearest missing capability in Public. We already have retrieval, session recovery, and code-graph context, but not a low-cost integrity pass for markdown truthfulness.
- **Recommendation**: adopt now
- **Priority**: 1
- **Effort score**: 3/10
- **Impact**: high
- **Impact score**: 10/10

### Finding 2: Adopt Mex’s tiny guided maintenance surface as a DX principle
- **Source**: [cli.ts:8](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/src/cli.ts), [SYNC.md:1](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/SYNC.md), [session-bootstrap.ts:94](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/handlers/session-bootstrap.ts), [memory-crud-health.ts:426](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/handlers/memory-crud-health.ts), [memory-save.ts:1329](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/handlers/memory-save.ts)
- **What it does**: Mex keeps the public verbs small, exposes a cheat-sheet command, and always leaves a manual fallback or prompt-export path.
- **Why it matters**: Public’s primitives are stronger, but they are fragmented. We should adopt the UX principle now: fewer operator-facing recovery verbs, clearer next-action hints, and explicit fallback paths.
- **Recommendation**: adopt now
- **Priority**: 2
- **Effort score**: 2/10
- **Impact**: high
- **Impact score**: 8/10

### Finding 3: Build a provider-neutral `spec-kit doctor` loop
- **Source**: [README.md:96](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/README.md), [sync/index.ts:29](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/src/sync/index.ts), [brief-builder.ts:7](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/src/sync/brief-builder.ts), [memory-crud-health.ts:455](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/handlers/memory-crud-health.ts), [memory-save.ts:1344](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/handlers/memory-save.ts)
- **What it does**: Mex’s strongest reusable pattern is `detect -> build repair brief -> fix -> recheck -> repeat`, with file-scoped evidence and score delta after each cycle.
- **Why it matters**: Public already has `session_bootstrap`, `memory_health`, `memory_save(dryRun)`, `memory_index_scan`, and `code_graph_scan`; what it lacks is one workflow that owns closure from diagnosis through rerun.
- **Recommendation**: NEW FEATURE
- **Priority**: 3
- **Effort score**: 7/10
- **Impact**: high
- **Impact score**: 9/10

### Finding 4: Use staleness as trust metadata, not as truth
- **Source**: [staleness.ts:1](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/src/drift/checkers/staleness.ts), [git.ts:12](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/src/git.ts), [reporter.ts:16](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/src/reporter.ts)
- **What it does**: Mex flags scaffold files by elapsed days and commits-since-change using fixed 30/90 day and 50/200 commit thresholds.
- **Why it matters**: The dual signal is useful, but only as provenance or confidence metadata. In Public, git availability and repo activity vary too much for these thresholds to become a hard integrity gate.
- **Recommendation**: prototype later
- **Priority**: 4
- **Effort score**: 4/10
- **Impact**: medium
- **Impact score**: 6/10

### Finding 5: Keep markdown scaffold growth optional and secondary

- **What it does**: Mex’s `GROW` loop updates context and patterns after each task, treating the scaffold as a living playbook.
- **Why it matters**: That is useful for repeatable operational guidance, but it should stay a companion docs layer in Public, not a default mutation path for durable memory authority.
- **Recommendation**: prototype later
- **Priority**: 5
- **Effort score**: 5/10
- **Impact**: medium
- **Impact score**: 5/10

### Finding 6: Reject markdown-first scaffold as the core memory substrate
- **Source**: [README.md:24](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/README.md), [README.md:200](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/README.md), [memory-context.ts:15](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/handlers/memory-context.ts), [session-bootstrap.ts:163](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/handlers/session-bootstrap.ts), [memory-triggers.ts:24](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/handlers/memory-triggers.ts)
- **What it does**: Mex treats navigable markdown as the main durable project memory, with CLI enforcement around it.
- **Why it matters**: Replacing Spec Kit Memory with that model would be a regression against hybrid retrieval, session-aware recall, causal links, and structural code-graph tooling.
- **Recommendation**: reject
- **Priority**: 6
- **Effort score**: 9/10
- **Impact**: high
- **Impact score**: 8/10

### Finding 7: Reject a single blended drift score as the primary health surface
- **Source**: [README.md:81](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/README.md), [scoring.ts:1](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/src/drift/scoring.ts), [reporter.ts:16](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/src/reporter.ts)
- **What it does**: Mex compresses all issues into `100 - 10/error - 3/warning - 1/info` and surfaces that as the main health signal.
- **Why it matters**: Public needs evidence by subsystem. A single number hides whether the real problem is markdown integrity, retrieval quality, stale graph context, or save/index health.
- **Recommendation**: reject
- **Priority**: 7
- **Effort score**: 2/10
- **Impact**: medium
- **Impact score**: 7/10

## Assessment
- **New information ratio**: 0.10
- **Updated classification**: `adopt now` = static markdown integrity lane, simplified guided maintenance surface; `prototype later` = dual freshness metadata, optional scaffold-growth companion; `reject` = markdown-first memory replacement, score-first health; `NEW FEATURE` = `spec-kit doctor`
- **Definitive recommendation**: do not import Mex wholesale. Transplant only the lexical integrity layer and the repair-loop DX, while keeping retrieval, graph, and durable memory authority inside Spec Kit Memory.
- **Validation status**: strict validation for the phase folder passed with `Errors: 0  Warnings: 0`, though the script emitted a sandbox temp-file warning during execution.
- **Write status**: this session is read-only, so I could not update [research.md](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/research/research.md), create `implementation-summary.md`, or persist the final synthesis into the phase folder.

## Recommended Next Focus
1. Specify a narrow integrity phase: `path`, `edge`, and `index-sync` checks only, reported by severity and kept separate from recall scoring.
2. Design `spec-kit doctor` around existing primitives: `session_bootstrap -> memory_health -> memory_save(dryRun) -> optional repair brief -> recheck -> next hints`.
3. Revisit broader command/dependency/script audits only after a provider-neutral inventory model exists for npm, shell, Python, MCP commands, wrappers, and spec docs.

# Iteration 030: FINAL EXTENDED SYNTHESIS

## Focus
FINAL EXTENDED SYNTHESIS: integrate iterations 1-29, lock the recommendation tiers, and turn the Mex research into one definitive decision set for Spec Kit Memory.

## Findings
### Finding 1: Add a separate markdown integrity lane for dead references and index drift
- **Source**: [README.md:72](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/README.md), [claims.ts:37](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/src/drift/claims.ts), [path.ts:8](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/src/drift/checkers/path.ts), [edges.ts:5](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/src/drift/checkers/edges.ts), [index-sync.ts:6](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/src/drift/checkers/index-sync.ts)
- **What it does**: Mex extracts typed claims from markdown, then statically checks missing paths, dead frontmatter edges, and `patterns/INDEX.md` drift before any AI repair.
- **Why it matters**: This is the clearest missing capability in Public. We already have retrieval, session recovery, and code-graph context, but not a low-cost integrity pass for markdown truthfulness.
- **Recommendation**: adopt now
- **Priority**: 1
- **Effort score**: 3/10
- **Impact**: high
- **Impact score**: 10/10

### Finding 2: Adopt Mex’s tiny guided maintenance surface as a DX principle
- **Source**: [cli.ts:8](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/src/cli.ts), [SYNC.md:1](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/SYNC.md), [session-bootstrap.ts:94](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/handlers/session-bootstrap.ts), [memory-crud-health.ts:426](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/handlers/memory-crud-health.ts), [memory-save.ts:1329](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/handlers/memory-save.ts)
- **What it does**: Mex keeps the public verbs small, exposes a cheat-sheet command, and always leaves a manual fallback or prompt-export path.
- **Why it matters**: Public’s primitives are stronger, but they are fragmented. We should adopt the UX principle now: fewer operator-facing recovery verbs, clearer next-action hints, and explicit fallback paths.
- **Recommendation**: adopt now
- **Priority**: 2
- **Effort score**: 2/10
- **Impact**: high
- **Impact score**: 8/10

### Finding 3: Build a provider-neutral `spec-kit doctor` loop
- **Source**: [README.md:96](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/README.md), [sync/index.ts:29](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/src/sync/index.ts), [brief-builder.ts:7](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/src/sync/brief-builder.ts), [memory-crud-health.ts:455](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/handlers/memory-crud-health.ts), [memory-save.ts:1344](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/handlers/memory-save.ts)
- **What it does**: Mex’s strongest reusable pattern is `detect -> build repair brief -> fix -> recheck -> repeat`, with file-scoped evidence and score delta after each cycle.
- **Why it matters**: Public already has `session_bootstrap`, `memory_health`, `memory_save(dryRun)`, `memory_index_scan`, and `code_graph_scan`; what it lacks is one workflow that owns closure from diagnosis through rerun.
- **Recommendation**: NEW FEATURE
- **Priority**: 3
- **Effort score**: 7/10
- **Impact**: high
- **Impact score**: 9/10

### Finding 4: Use staleness as trust metadata, not as truth
- **Source**: [staleness.ts:1](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/src/drift/checkers/staleness.ts), [git.ts:12](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/src/git.ts), [reporter.ts:16](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/src/reporter.ts)
- **What it does**: Mex flags scaffold files by elapsed days and commits-since-change using fixed 30/90 day and 50/200 commit thresholds.
- **Why it matters**: The dual signal is useful, but only as provenance or confidence metadata. In Public, git availability and repo activity vary too much for these thresholds to become a hard integrity gate.
- **Recommendation**: prototype later
- **Priority**: 4
- **Effort score**: 4/10
- **Impact**: medium
- **Impact score**: 6/10

### Finding 5: Keep markdown scaffold growth optional and secondary
- **Source**: [README.md:178](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/README.md), [AGENTS.md:37](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/AGENTS.md), [ROUTER.md:56](/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.opencode/specs/system-spec-kit/999-hybrid-rag-fusion-upgrade/001-research-hybrid-rag-fusion-systems/002-mex-main/external/ROUTER.md)
