# MPAB chunk-to-memory aggregation

## Current Reality

When a memory file splits into chunks, each chunk gets its own score. Multi-Parent Aggregated Bonus combines those chunk scores into a single memory-level score using the formula `sMax + 0.3 * sum(remaining) / sqrt(N)`. The top chunk score becomes the base, and the remaining chunks contribute a damped bonus.

Guards handle the edge cases: N=0 returns 0, N=1 returns the raw score and N>1 applies MPAB. The bonus coefficient (0.3) is exported as `MPAB_BONUS_COEFFICIENT` for tuning. The aggregation runs in Stage 3 of the 4-stage pipeline after RRF fusion and before state filtering. Runs behind the `SPECKIT_DOCSCORE_AGGREGATION` flag (default ON).
