# Architecture boundary enforcement

## Current Reality

Two architecture rules in `ARCHITECTURE_BOUNDARIES.md` were previously documentation-only with no automated enforcement: (1) `shared/` must not import from `mcp_server/` or `scripts/`, and (2) `mcp_server/scripts/` must contain only thin compatibility wrappers delegating to canonical `scripts/dist/` implementations.

`check-architecture-boundaries.ts` enforces both rules as part of `npm run check`. GAP A walks all `.ts` files in `shared/`, extracts module specifiers (skipping block and line comments), and flags any import matching relative paths to `mcp_server/` or `scripts/` at any depth, or package-form `@spec-kit/mcp-server/` or `@spec-kit/scripts/`. This is an absolute prohibition with no allowlist.

GAP B scans top-level `.ts` files in `mcp_server/scripts/` (non-recursive) and verifies each passes three conditions: at most 50 substantive lines (non-blank, non-comment), contains a `child_process` import, and references `scripts/dist/` somewhere in its content. Failure on any condition flags the file as not a valid wrapper.
