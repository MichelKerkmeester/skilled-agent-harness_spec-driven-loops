# Reporting dashboard (eval_reporting_dashboard)

## Current Reality

Generates a sprint-level and channel-level metric dashboard from stored evaluation runs. You can filter by sprint, channel and metric, and choose between text (markdown-formatted) or JSON output.

The dashboard aggregates per-sprint metric summaries (mean, min, max, latest, count) and per-channel performance views (hit count, average latency, query count) from the `eval_metric_snapshots`, `eval_channel_results` and `eval_final_results` tables. Trend analysis compares consecutive runs to detect regressions. Sprint labels are inferred from metadata JSON or `eval_run_id` grouping. A `isHigherBetter()` helper correctly interprets trend direction for different metric types (recall and precision are higher-better; latency is lower-better).

This is a read-only module. It queries the eval database and produces reports. No writes, no side effects, no feature flag gate.
