# Typed-weighted degree channel

## Current Reality

A fifth RRF channel scores memories by their graph connectivity. Edge type weights range from caused at 1.0 down to supports at 0.5, with logarithmic normalization and a hub cap (`MAX_TYPED_DEGREE=15`, `MAX_TOTAL_DEGREE=50`, `DEGREE_BOOST_CAP=0.15`) to prevent any single memory from dominating results through connections alone.

Constitutional memories are excluded from degree boosting because they already receive top-tier visibility. The channel runs behind the `SPECKIT_DEGREE_BOOST` feature flag with a degree cache that invalidates only on graph mutations, not per query. When a memory has zero edges, the channel returns 0 rather than failing.
