# Memory browser (memory_list)

## Current Reality

Paginated browsing of everything the memory system knows. You can sort by creation date, update date or importance weight. Filter by spec folder. Optionally include child chunk rows alongside parent memories (off by default for cleaner browsing).

Each entry shows its numeric ID, spec folder, title, creation and update timestamps, importance weight, trigger phrase count and file path. The response includes a total count and pagination hints (like "More results available: use offset: 40") for navigating forward. Default page size is 20, maximum is 100.

This is the starting point for any manual memory management workflow. Need to delete a specific memory? Browse to find its ID. Want to audit what is indexed under a spec folder? Filter by folder and scan the results. Wondering why a memory is not surfacing in search? Look up its importance weight and tier here.
