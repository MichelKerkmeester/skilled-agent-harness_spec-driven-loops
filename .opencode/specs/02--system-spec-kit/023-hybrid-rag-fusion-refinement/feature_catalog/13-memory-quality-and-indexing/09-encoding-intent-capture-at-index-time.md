# Encoding-intent capture at index time

## Current Reality

An `encoding_intent` field classifies content type at index time as `document`, `code` or `structured_data` using heuristic scoring. The code path scores fenced code blocks, import/export/function keyword density and programming punctuation density. The structured data path scores YAML frontmatter, pipe tables and key-value patterns. The classification threshold is 0.4; anything below defaults to `document`.

The classification is stored as read-only metadata on the `encoding_intent` column for both parent records and individual chunks. It has no retrieval-time scoring impact. The intent is to build a labeled dataset that future work can use for type-aware retrieval. Runs behind the `SPECKIT_ENCODING_INTENT` flag (default ON).
