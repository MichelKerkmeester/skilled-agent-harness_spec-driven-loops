# Workspace scanning and indexing (memory_index_scan)

## Current Reality

This is the tool that keeps the memory database synchronized with the filesystem. Without it, new or modified memory files would be invisible to search.

The scanner discovers files from three sources: spec folder memory files (`specs/**/memory/*.md`), constitutional files (`.opencode/skill/*/constitutional/*.md`) and spec documents (`spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`, `checklist.md`, `decision-record.md`, `implementation-summary.md`, `research.md`, `handover.md`). Canonical path deduplication prevents the same file from being indexed twice under different paths (the `specs/` vs `.opencode/specs/` symlink problem).

In incremental mode (the default), the scanner categorizes every discovered file into one of four buckets: to-index (new files), to-update (changed content hash), to-skip (unchanged mtime and hash) and to-delete (files that disappeared from disk). Batch processing with configurable `BATCH_SIZE` handles large workspaces. A rate limiter with `INDEX_SCAN_COOLDOWN` prevents rapid repeated scans from exhausting resources, returning an E429 error with a wait time if you scan too frequently.

Each file that passes through to indexing goes through the full `memory_save` pipeline, which means content normalization, quality gating, reconsolidation, chunk thinning and encoding-intent capture all apply automatically. Large files are split into chunks, and anchor-aware chunk thinning drops low-scoring chunks before they enter the index.

After indexing, the tool does more than store data. It creates causal chain edges between spec documents within the same folder (spec leads to plan, plan leads to tasks, tasks lead to checklist, and so on). It detects alias conflicts. It runs divergence reconciliation hooks. It clears the trigger matcher cache if any changes occurred.

A safety invariant protects against silent failures: post-indexing mtime updates happen only for successfully indexed files. If embedding generation fails for a specific file, that file retains its old mtime so the next scan automatically retries it. You do not have to track which files failed. The system tracks it for you.

The result breakdown is detailed: indexed count, updated count, unchanged count, failed count, skipped-by-mtime count, skipped-by-hash count, constitutional stats, dedup stats and incremental stats. Debug mode (`SPECKIT_DEBUG_INDEX_SCAN=true`) exposes additional file count diagnostics.
