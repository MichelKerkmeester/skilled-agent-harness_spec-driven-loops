# Cross-document entity linking

## Current Reality

Memories in different spec folders often discuss the same concepts without any explicit connection between them. A decision record in one folder mentions "embedding cache" and an implementation summary in another folder implements it, but the retrieval system has no way to connect them unless a causal edge exists.

Cross-document entity linking bridges this gap using the entity catalog populated by R10. The `buildEntityCatalog()` function groups entities from the `memory_entities` table by canonical name. The `findCrossDocumentMatches()` function identifies entities appearing in two or more distinct spec folders, which represent genuine cross-document relationships.

For each cross-document match, `createEntityLinks()` inserts causal edges with `relation='supports'`, `strength=0.7` and `created_by='entity_linker'`. The `supports` relation was chosen over adding a new relation type to avoid ALTER TABLE complexity on the SQLite `causal_edges` CHECK constraint. Entity-derived links are genuinely supportive relationships: if two documents reference the same entity, they support each other's context.

An infrastructure gate checks that the `entity_catalog` has entries before running. Without R10 providing extracted entities, S5 has nothing to operate on. The `runEntityLinking()` orchestrator chains catalog build, match finding and edge creation with statistics reporting.

**Sprint 8 update:** Two performance improvements were applied to `entity-linker.ts`: (1) a parallel `Set` was added for `catalogSets` providing O(1) `.has()` lookups instead of O(n) `.includes()` in inner loops, and (2) a `batchGetEdgeCounts()` function replaced N+1 individual `getEdgeCount` queries with a single batch query.

A density guard prevents runaway edge creation: current global edge density is computed as `total_edges / total_memories` and checked before link generation begins. The linker also checks projected post-insert global density before creating links. If either check exceeds the configured threshold, new entity links are skipped to avoid overwhelming the graph. The threshold is controlled by `SPECKIT_ENTITY_LINKING_MAX_DENSITY` (default `1.0`), and invalid or negative values fall back to `1.0`. Runs behind the `SPECKIT_ENTITY_LINKING` flag (default ON). Depends on a populated `entity_catalog` (typically produced by R10 auto-entities).
