# Async ingestion job lifecycle

## Current Reality

**IMPLEMENTED (Sprint 019).** Ingestion moves to a SQLite-persisted job queue (`lib/ops/job-queue.ts`) with lifecycle states `queued → parsing → embedding → indexing → complete/failed/cancelled`, a single sequential worker (one job processing at a time, rest queued), and three new tools: `memory_ingest_start`, `memory_ingest_status`, `memory_ingest_cancel`. Coexists with the existing `asyncEmbedding` path in `memory_save` as an alternative for batch operations.
