# Constitutional memory as expert knowledge injection

## Current Reality

Constitutional-tier memories receive a `retrieval_directive` metadata field formatted as explicit instruction prefixes for LLM consumption. Examples: "Always surface when: user asks about memory save rules" or "Prioritize when: debugging search quality."

Rule patterns are extracted from content using a ranked list of imperative verbs (must, always, never, should, require) and condition-introducing words (when, if, for, during). Scanning is capped at 2,000 characters from the start of content, and each directive component is capped at 120 characters. The `enrichWithRetrievalDirectives()` function maps over results without filtering or reordering. The enrichment is wired into `hooks/memory-surface.ts` before returning results.
