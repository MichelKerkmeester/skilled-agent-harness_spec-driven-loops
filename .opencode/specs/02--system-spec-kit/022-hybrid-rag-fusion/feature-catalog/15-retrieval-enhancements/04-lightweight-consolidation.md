# Lightweight consolidation

## Current Reality

Four sub-components handle ongoing memory graph maintenance as a weekly batch cycle. Contradiction scanning finds memory pairs above 0.85 cosine similarity with keyword negation conflicts using a dual strategy: vector-based (cosine on sqlite-vec embeddings) plus heuristic fallback (word overlap). Both use a `hasNegationConflict()` keyword asymmetry check against approximately 20 negation terms (not, never, deprecated, replaced, and others). The system surfaces full contradiction clusters rather than isolated pairs via 1-hop causal edge neighbor expansion.

Hebbian edge strengthening reinforces recently accessed edges at +0.05 per cycle with a 30-day decay of 0.1, respecting the auto-edge strength cap. Staleness detection flags edges unfetched for 90 or more days without deleting them. Edge bounds enforcement reports current edge counts versus the 20-edge-per-node maximum.

All weight modifications are logged to the `weight_history` table. The cycle fires after every successful `memory_save` when enabled. Runs behind the `SPECKIT_CONSOLIDATION` flag (default ON).
