# Auto-promotion on validation

## Current Reality

Positive validations now trigger automatic tier promotion. When a normal-tier memory accumulates 5 positive validations, it is promoted to important. When an important-tier memory reaches 10, it is promoted to critical. A throttle safeguard limits promotions to 3 per 8-hour rolling window to prevent runaway promotion during bulk validation sessions.

Constitutional, critical, temporary and deprecated tiers are non-promotable. Each promotion is logged to a `memory_promotion_audit` table for traceability. The `memory_validate` response includes `autoPromotion` metadata showing whether promotion was attempted, the previous and new tier, validation count and the reason.
