# Verification Checklist: evaluation

<!-- SPECKIT_LEVEL: 2 -->
<!-- SPECKIT_TEMPLATE_SOURCE: checklist | v2.2 -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:protocol -->
## Verification Protocol

| Priority | Handling | Completion Impact |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| **[P0]** | HARD BLOCKER | Cannot claim done until complete |
| **[P1]** | Required | Must complete OR get user approval |
| **[P2]** | Optional | Can defer with documented reason |
<!-- /ANCHOR:protocol -->

---

## P0 - Blockers

P0 items below are complete and include inline evidence.

---

<!-- ANCHOR:pre-impl -->
## Pre-Implementation

- [x] CHK-001 [P0] F-01 and F-02 requirements documented in `spec.md` — REQ-001 through REQ-004 cover both features [EVIDENCE: See phase evidence in spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md, and implementation-summary.md]
- [x] CHK-002 [P0] Technical remediation approach defined in `plan.md` — 3 phases with TypeScript/MCP/SQLite/Vitest stack [EVIDENCE: See phase evidence in spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md, and implementation-summary.md]
- [x] CHK-003 [P1] Dependencies identified (`MCP handlers`, `SQLite eval tables`, `Vitest harness`) — eval-reporting.ts, reporting-dashboard.ts, ablation-framework.ts, eval-db.ts [EVIDENCE: See phase evidence in spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md, and implementation-summary.md]
<!-- /ANCHOR:pre-impl -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:code-quality -->
## Code Quality

- [x] CHK-010 [P0] F-02 `eval_final_results` behavior mismatch resolved or catalog-corrected — stale comment in reporting-dashboard.ts and catalog claim in F-02 corrected; dashboard only queries `eval_metric_snapshots` + `eval_channel_results` [EVIDENCE: See phase evidence in spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md, and implementation-summary.md]
- [x] CHK-011 [P0] No evaluation handler warnings/errors in targeted test runs — 97/97 tests pass, tsc clean [EVIDENCE: See phase evidence in spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md, and implementation-summary.md]
- [x] CHK-012 [P1] Error handling paths validated (ablation disabled, dashboard failures) — T006-A1 (disabled flag throws), T005-D3 (DB unavailable throws) [EVIDENCE: See phase evidence in spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md, and implementation-summary.md]
- [x] CHK-013 [P1] TypeScript implementation follows existing project patterns — vi.hoisted mocks, vi.mock, handler-level test structure matches handler-memory-*.vitest.ts patterns [EVIDENCE: See phase evidence in spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md, and implementation-summary.md]
<!-- /ANCHOR:code-quality -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:testing -->
## Testing

- [x] CHK-020 [P0] `handleEvalReportingDashboard` filter/format behavior verified with handler-level tests — T005-D1 (text default), T005-D2 (json format), T005-D3 (DB error) [EVIDENCE: See phase evidence in spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md, and implementation-summary.md]
- [x] CHK-021 [P0] `handleEvalRunAblation` normalization/flag behavior verified with handler-level tests — T006-A1 (disabled), T006-A2 (empty/invalid→ALL_CHANNELS), T006-A3 (mixed filter), T006-A4 (recallK default 20), T006-A5 (recallK clamped >=1), T006-A6 (DB-not-init), T006-A7 (null-report), T006-A8 (storeResults=false), T006-A9 (includeFormattedReport=false) [EVIDENCE: See phase evidence in spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md, and implementation-summary.md]
- [x] CHK-022 [P1] Edge cases tested (`storeResults=false`, `includeFormattedReport=false`, `recallK` boundaries) — recallK boundaries (T006-A4, T006-A5), channel normalization (T006-A2, T006-A3), storeResults=false (T006-A8), includeFormattedReport=false (T006-A9), DB-not-init (T006-A6), null-report (T006-A7) [EVIDENCE: See phase evidence in spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md, and implementation-summary.md]
- [x] CHK-023 [P1] Stale `retry.vitest.ts` references removed or replaced with valid coverage — grep confirmed 0 matches in feature_catalog/07--evaluation/ [EVIDENCE: See phase evidence in spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md, and implementation-summary.md]
<!-- /ANCHOR:testing -->

<!-- ANCHOR:security -->
## Security

- [x] CHK-030 [P0] No hardcoded secrets introduced — no secrets in any diff; only comment and catalog text corrections [EVIDENCE: See phase evidence in spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md, and implementation-summary.md]
- [x] CHK-031 [P0] Input normalization for channel/filter/limit parameters validated — T006-A2 (empty→ALL_CHANNELS), T006-A3 (mixed→valid only), T006-A5 (recallK clamp) [EVIDENCE: See phase evidence in spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md, and implementation-summary.md]
- [x] CHK-032 [P1] Auth/authz behavior remains correct after remediation — no auth-sensitive code modified; handler validation paths preserved [EVIDENCE: See phase evidence in spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md, and implementation-summary.md]
<!-- /ANCHOR:security -->

## P1 - Required

P1 items are complete and include inline evidence unless explicitly deferred.

---

<!-- ANCHOR:docs -->
## Documentation

- [x] CHK-040 [P1] Feature catalog Current Reality for F-02 matches implementation — F-02 catalog updated: removed `eval_final_results` claim, now correctly states `eval_metric_snapshots` + `eval_channel_results` [EVIDENCE: See phase evidence in spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md, and implementation-summary.md]
- [x] CHK-041 [P1] `spec.md`, `plan.md`, and `tasks.md` are synchronized — all 4 docs updated with implementation evidence [EVIDENCE: See phase evidence in spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md, and implementation-summary.md]
- [x] CHK-042 [P2] Evidence references (files/lines, `EX-032`, `EX-033`) captured — playbook mapping documented in spec.md; findings tied to handler and service files [EVIDENCE: See phase evidence in spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md, and implementation-summary.md]
<!-- /ANCHOR:docs -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:file-org -->
## File Organization

- [x] CHK-050 [P1] Temp files in scratch/ only — no temp files created outside scratch/ [EVIDENCE: See phase evidence in spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md, and implementation-summary.md]
- [x] CHK-051 [P1] scratch/ cleaned before completion — no scratch files generated [EVIDENCE: See phase evidence in spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md, and implementation-summary.md]
- [x] CHK-052 [P2] Findings saved to memory/ — spec folder complete with all evidence [EVIDENCE: See phase evidence in spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md, and implementation-summary.md]
