# /create:skill-parent Router

This command is a thin router. It separates execution routing from user-facing presentation.

## 1. ROUTER CONTRACT

Route /create:skill-parent to its presentation contract and workflow YAML for scaffolding or updating a parent skill with nested mode packets.

- This command is the canonical `/create:skill-parent` entrypoint.
- Do not split behavior across legacy or ad-hoc parent-skill scaffolders.
- Do not edit workflow YAML while executing this command.

**One-Identity Invariant:**

- The hub owns exactly one `graph-metadata.json`. This is the load-bearing keystone: skill-graph discovery keys only on `graph-metadata.json` and throws when `skill_id` does not equal its folder.
- NEVER add a `graph-metadata.json` inside a mode packet or inside `shared/`. A nested `graph-metadata.json` creates a rogue advisor identity (B-style discovery drift) and re-introduces the multi-ID brittleness this pattern removes.
- The mode packets and `shared/` stay non-discoverable by design; their invisibility is a consequence of nesting, not a special mechanism.

## 2. OWNED ASSETS

| Purpose | Asset |
|---------|-------|
| Presentation contract | `.opencode/commands/create/assets/create_skill_parent_presentation.txt` |
| Auto workflow | `.opencode/commands/create/assets/create_skill_parent_auto.yaml` |
| Confirm workflow | `.opencode/commands/create/assets/create_skill_parent_confirm.yaml` |

## 3. MODE ROUTING

- If any referenced asset is missing, stop and report the missing path.
- The YAML owns workflow behavior; the presentation Markdown owns user-visible wording and layout.

## 4. EXECUTION TARGETS

1. Read `.opencode/commands/create/assets/create_skill_parent_presentation.txt`.
2. Run the presentation contract's Phase 0 verification and setup resolution.
3. Resolve execution mode from `$ARGUMENTS` or the setup answer: `:auto` or `:confirm`.
4. Resolve operation from setup: `create` or `update`.
5. Load exactly one workflow YAML:
   - `:auto` -> `.opencode/commands/create/assets/create_skill_parent_auto.yaml`
   - `:confirm` or omitted mode -> `.opencode/commands/create/assets/create_skill_parent_confirm.yaml`
6. Execute the selected YAML step by step and route to the resolved operation branch.
7. Use the presentation contract, not this router, for user prompts, setup/status dashboards, and final result display.

## 5. PRESENTATION BOUNDARY

The following content lives only in `.opencode/commands/create/assets/create_skill_parent_presentation.txt`:

- Startup questions, Phase 0 verification, setup dashboard, operation display, status display, completion template, and next-step text.

The router must not invent visible wording for those surfaces; it only resolves operation, execution mode, and workflow selection.

## 6. WORKFLOW SUMMARY

The bound workflow YAML (`create_skill_parent_auto.yaml` for `:auto`, `create_skill_parent_confirm.yaml` for `:confirm` or an omitted mode) runs the parent-skill scaffolding workflow step by step after Phase 0 verification and setup resolution, then routes to the resolved `create` or `update` operation branch. `:auto` executes autonomously; `:confirm` runs the same steps as an interactive checkpointed workflow. All user-facing prompts, setup/status dashboards, and result display come from the presentation contract, not this router.

**What This Scaffolds:**

This command generates the "parent skill with nested mode packets" pattern following the two-axis hub canon. The canonical example is `sk-code` (workflow modes plus read-only surface packets); `system-deep-loop` is the runtime-loop variant that expresses its extra machinery as named `extensions`. The pattern is standardized in `.opencode/skills/sk-doc/create-skill/references/parent_skill/parent_skills_nested_packets.md`, and the hub-router contract in `.opencode/skills/sk-doc/create-skill/references/parent_skill/parent_hub_router_schema.md`. The templates are `parent_skill_hub_template.md`, `parent_skill_registry_template.json`, `parent_skill_hub_router_template.json`, `parent_skill_description_template.json`, and `parent_skill_graph_metadata_template.json` under `.opencode/skills/sk-doc/create-skill/assets/skill/`.

The generated package is:

- A thin hub `SKILL.md` (routing only, no per-mode logic).
- A declarative `mode-registry.json` where every mode carries the two-axis discriminator — `workflowMode` + `packetKind` (`workflow` | `surface`) + `backendKind` — plus `toolSurface`, `grandfatheredFolderMismatch`, and one `advisorRouting` block (`routingClass`, `legacyAdvisorId` for lexical/alias-fold modes, optional `advisorDefaultMode`, `legacyAliases`, `packetSkillName`). The registry is the single source of truth; routers and tests read it, none re-derive it.
- A `hub-router.json` describing how a prompt selects and bundles modes (routerSignals, typed vocabularyClasses, tieBreak, and a `surfaceBundle` outcome when surfaces exist), and a `description.json`.
- Exactly one hub `graph-metadata.json` — the one hard invariant.
- N workflow mode packets, each self-contained with its own `SKILL.md`, `README.md`, and `changelog/`, where `folder == packetSkillName == [hub-prefix]-<mode>`, and with NO per-packet `graph-metadata.json`.
- Optional read-only `surface` packets (bare-noun folders, `packetKind: surface`, `backendKind: evidence-base`, read-only `toolSurface`, advisor-invisible `metadata` routing) carrying domain evidence rather than process.
- A hub `changelog/` and `manual_testing_playbook/` (changelog entries are real files, never symlinks).
- A non-discoverable `shared/` directory (with `shared/README.md`) for packet-shared workflow-layer helpers.
