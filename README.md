## 1. OVERVIEW

### What is OpenCode?

AI coding assistants have amnesia. Every session starts from zero. You explain your architecture Monday. By Wednesday, it is gone. Every decision, every trade-off, every carefully reasoned choice -- lost the moment the conversation window closes. This framework fixes that.

OpenCode is a multi-agent AI development framework built on top of the [OpenCode](https://github.com/sst/opencode) platform. It gives your AI assistant a filing cabinet, long-term memory and a team of specialists -- instead of one forgetful generalist starting from scratch every session.

The framework adds three layers on top of the base platform:

1. **Structured documentation** (Spec Kit) -- every file change gets a spec folder recording what changed, why and how. Like a lab notebook for software.
2. **Cognitive memory** (MCP server) -- a local-first memory engine storing decisions, context and project history in a searchable database. Like a personal librarian who remembers every conversation.
3. **Coordinated agents** -- 12 specialized agents routed by a gate system that loads the right skills at the right time. Like a team where the project manager delegates to the right specialist.

**Who it is for:** Developers using AI assistants who are tired of re-explaining context every session and watching decisions disappear into chat history.

## 2. QUICK START

### Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/MichelKerkmeester/opencode-spec-kit-framework.git
cd opencode-spec-kit-framework

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Build the memory server scripts
cd .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server && npm install && npm run build
cd ../../../../

# 4. Build the CLI scripts
cd .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts && npm install && npm run build
cd ../../../../
```

### Set Up Embedding Provider

Choose an embedding provider:

```bash
# Option A: Voyage AI (recommended -- best quality)
export VOYAGE_API_KEY="your-key-here"

# Option B: OpenAI embeddings
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key-here"

# Option C: HuggingFace Local (free, no API key needed)
# No setup required -- auto-detected when no API keys are set
```

### Verify Installation

```bash
# Check that the memory server builds correctly
node .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/dist/context-server.js --help

# Expected: help output with available options
```

### First Use

Open OpenCode in your project directory. The framework is active. Try:

```
/spec_kit:complete Build a user authentication system
```

This creates a spec folder, runs research, builds a plan and begins implementation -- all with memory saved automatically. When you come back tomorrow, the memory engine remembers everything.

## 3. FEATURES

---

### 3.1 SPEC KIT DOCUMENTATION

The Spec Kit enforces structured spec folders for every file-modifying conversation. Gate 3 requires a spec folder answer before any file modification begins (only typo/whitespace fixes under 5 characters are exempt).


#### Documentation Levels

Documentation depth scales with task complexity.

| Level | LOC Guidance | Required Files | When to Use |
|-------|-------------|----------------|-------------|
| **1** | < 100 | spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md, implementation-summary.md | Small features, bug fixes, single-file changes |
| **2** | 100 - 499 | Level 1 + checklist.md | Features needing QA verification, multi-file changes |
| **3** | 500+ | Level 2 + decision-record.md | Architecture changes, complex refactors |
| **3+** | Complexity 80+ | Level 3 + governance extensions | Multi-agent work, enterprise sign-offs |

The LOC ranges are guidance, not hard rules. Risk, complexity and the number of affected files can push a task to a higher level. When in doubt, choose the higher level.

**Implementation-summary.md** is required at all levels but created **after** implementation completes, not at spec folder creation time.


#### Spec Folder Structure

```text
specs/<###-feature-name>/
├── description.json             # Spec identity and memory tracking metadata
├── spec.md                      # What the feature is and why it exists
├── plan.md                      # How to implement it
├── tasks.md                     # Step-by-step task breakdown
├── checklist.md                 # QA validation gates (Level 2+)
├── decision-record.md           # Architecture decisions (Level 3+)
├── implementation-summary.md    # Post-implementation summary (all levels)
├── memory/                      # Session context files (via generate-context.js)
│   └── YY-MM-DD_HH-MM__topic.md
└── scratch/                     # Temporary workspace files (gitignored)
```

#### Checklist Priority System (Level 2+)

Checklists use a priority system so reviewers know what blocks shipping and what can wait:

- **P0** — Hard blocker. Cannot ship without this. Cannot defer.
- **P1** — Required. Must complete or get explicit user approval to defer.
- **P2** — Optional. Nice to have. Can defer without approval.


#### Phase Decomposition

Phase decomposition splits large features into a parent spec folder (overall specification) and child folders (one per phase).

```text
specs/022-big-feature/             # Parent spec folder
├── spec.md                        # Overall specification
├── 001-data-model/                # Phase 1 child
│   ├── spec.md
│   └── ...
├── 002-api-endpoints/             # Phase 2 child
│   ├── spec.md
│   └── ...
└── 003-frontend/                  # Phase 3 child
    ├── spec.md
    └── ...
```

Use `create.sh --phase` to create a parent with its first child in one step. Run `validate.sh --recursive` to validate the parent and all children together.

#### Validation

The `validate.sh` script runs 20 rules against a spec folder and reports what passes and what needs fixing. Rules check for required files, template compliance, placeholder detection, anchor markers and cross-reference consistency.

- **Exit 0** — All rules pass. Ready to proceed.
- **Exit 1** — Warnings found. Review and fix if practical.
- **Exit 2** — Errors found. Must fix before claiming completion.

Run with `--verbose` to see details behind each rule or `--recursive` to validate a parent and all child phase folders.


#### Scripts and Validation

**Spec Management Scripts** (12 in `scripts/spec/`):

- **`create.sh`** — Create spec folders with level-appropriate templates. Use `--phase` for parent + child
- **`validate.sh`** — Run 20 validation rules. Use `--recursive` for phase folders
- **`upgrade-level.sh`** — Inject addendum templates to upgrade a folder to a higher level
- **`recommend-level.sh`** — Analyze scope and risk to recommend the right documentation level
- **`calculate-completeness.sh`** — Calculate spec folder completeness as a percentage
- **`check-completion.sh`** — Verify all completion criteria are met
- **`check-placeholders.sh`** — Find remaining `[PLACEHOLDER]` values after level upgrade

**Memory Scripts** (10 in `scripts/memory/`):

- **`generate-context.ts`** — Primary workflow for saving session context to memory files
- **`backfill-frontmatter.ts`** — Add missing frontmatter to existing memory files
- **`reindex-embeddings.ts`** — Rebuild embedding vectors for stored memories
- **`cleanup-orphaned-vectors.ts`** — Remove vector entries with no matching memory
- **`rebuild-auto-entities.ts`** — Regenerate auto-extracted entity catalog
- **`validate-memory-quality.ts`** — Run quality checks on stored memory content

TypeScript sources compile to `scripts/dist/`. The runtime entry point for memory saves is `scripts/dist/memory/generate-context.js`.

For the full spec folder workflow, template architecture (81 templates) and validation rules, see the [Spec Kit README](.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/README.md).


---

### 3.2 MEMORY ENGINE

The Memory Engine is a local-first cognitive memory system built as an MCP server. Memory files are created via `generate-context.js` and stored in spec folders. The MCP server indexes them with vector embeddings, BM25 and FTS5 full-text search. When you start a session, `memory_match_triggers()` surfaces relevant prior context automatically.

The memory engine uses a 222-feature pipeline developed across a 19-phase refinement program. The full 33-tool API reference is in the [MCP Server README](.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/README.md).


#### 33 Tools Across 7 Layers

The MCP tools are organized into a layered architecture. Each layer has a token budget that controls how much context it consumes:

| Layer | Name | Tools | Token Budget | Purpose |
|-------|------|-------|-------------|---------|
| **L1** | Orchestration | 1 | 2,000 | `memory_context` -- unified entry point for all retrieval |
| **L2** | Core | 4 | 1,500 | Search, quick search, trigger matching, save |
| **L3** | Discovery | 3 | 800 | List, stats, health checks |
| **L4** | Mutation | 4 | 500 | Delete, update, validate, bulk delete |
| **L5** | Lifecycle | 8 | 600 | Checkpoints, shared spaces, enable/status |
| **L6** | Analysis | 8 | 1,200 | Causal graph, epistemic baselines, ablation, dashboard |
| **L7** | Maintenance | 5 | 1,000 | Index scan, learning history, async ingestion (start/status/cancel) |
| | **Total** | **33** | **7,600** | |

Lower layers load only when needed. L1 is always available. L2 loads for any search. L3-L7 load based on the specific command being used.


#### HYBRID SEARCH

Every search checks five channels at once:

- **Vector** — Semantic similarity via embeddings. Finds related content when words differ.
- **FTS5** — Full-text search on exact words and phrases.
- **BM25** — Keyword relevance scoring.
- **Causal Graph** — Follows cause-and-effect links between memories.
- **Degree** — Scores by graph connectivity, weighted by edge type.

**Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)** combines results across channels so memories scoring well in multiple channels rise to the top. The system automatically escalates from vector-only to all 5 channels when confidence is low, truncates weak results, and ensures every active channel is represented.


#### SEARCH PIPELINE

Every search passes through 4 stages: **Gather** (parallel retrieval from active channels; constitutional-tier memories always inject), **Score** (RRF fusion with 8 post-fusion signals including co-activation, FSRS decay, interference penalties and intent-specific weights), **Rerank** (local cross-encoder model via node-llama-cpp; gracefully skips without VRAM), and **Filter** (confidence labels, state filtering, score immutability).


#### QUERY INTELLIGENCE

Before any search runs, the system classifies your query by complexity (simple/moderate/complex) and intent (7 types: `add_feature`, `fix_bug`, `refactor`, `security_audit`, `understand`, `find_spec`, `find_decision`). Each intent has its own channel weight profile.

Multi-topic queries are automatically split into sub-queries, expanded with related terms, and matched against pre-generated surrogates stored at index time. Context pressure monitoring downgrades search mode at 60% and 80% window usage. Low-confidence searches fall back to LLM reformulation or HyDE (Hypothetical Document Embeddings).

Four response modes format results by task: **quick** (top answer only), **focused** (one-topic), **deep** (full evidence trails), **resume** (state summary + next-steps).


#### MEMORY LIFECYCLE AND SCORING

Memories fade using **FSRS** (Free Spaced Repetition Scheduler). Decay speed varies by content type and importance tier -- critical decisions never fade; temporary debugging notes fade within days.

Key scoring signals: **cold-start boost** for fresh memories (under 48h), **interference penalty** to suppress near-duplicate clusters, **auto-promotion** (memories earn higher tiers through positive validation), and **negative feedback with 30-day decay** to prevent permanent blacklisting.

**Five cognitive states** based on access patterns: **HOT** >> **WARM** >> **COLD** >> **DORMANT** >> **ARCHIVED**. HOT memories get full content in results; COLD and below only surface if they score well enough.


#### CAUSAL GRAPH


The system tracks how decisions relate to each other through **six relationship types**: `caused`, `enabled`, `supersedes`, `contradicts`, `derived_from` and `supports`.

The graph supports typed-weighted traversal (prioritizing connection types based on query intent), community detection (Louvain) for cluster boosting, co-activation spreading with fan-effect dampening, temporal contiguity for same-session grouping, graph momentum for trending knowledge, and background LLM-assisted link discovery. Hub caps prevent any single highly-connected memory from dominating results.


#### SAVE INTELLIGENCE

When you save new knowledge, **Prediction Error gating** compares it against existing memories and picks one of four outcomes:

- **CREATE** — No similar memory exists. Stored as new knowledge.
- **REINFORCE** — Similar exists, new one adds value. Both kept, old one boosted.
- **UPDATE** — Similar exists, new one is better. Old version replaced.
- **SUPERSEDE** — New knowledge contradicts the old. Old one demoted to deprecated.

Additional save-time processing includes semantic sufficiency gating, verify-fix-verify quality loops, content normalization for cleaner embeddings, auto-entity extraction, SHA-256 deduplication, and correction tracking that records how knowledge evolves across versions.


#### SESSION AWARENESS

Working memory tracks findings from the current session with attention decay -- recent findings rank higher, older ones fade gracefully. Session deduplication suppresses already-seen results in follow-up queries. Context pressure monitoring downgrades search mode as the context window fills.


#### SHARED MEMORY

By default, every memory is private. Shared memory adds controlled access for multiple people or agents:

- **Spaces** -- named containers for shared knowledge
- **Roles** -- `owner` (full control), `editor` (read/write), `viewer` (read-only)
- **Deny-by-default** -- nobody gets access unless explicitly granted
- **Kill switch** -- immediately blocks all access for emergencies

For the full shared memory guide, see [SHARED_MEMORY_DATABASE.md](.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/SHARED_MEMORY_DATABASE.md).


#### QUALITY GATES AND LEARNING

Before a new memory enters the system, it passes three layered checks: **structure** (format, headings, metadata), **semantic sufficiency** (enough real content to be useful), and **duplicate detection** (triggers Prediction Error arbitration if similar content exists). Preview all checks without saving using `dryRun: true`.

**Learned relevance feedback** boosts helpful results in future queries, with multiple safeguards against noise. Results are tagged with high/medium/low confidence scores. Two-tier explainability shows either plain-language reasons or exact channel contributions.


#### RETRIEVAL ENHANCEMENTS

Additional retrieval signals include constitutional memory injection (always-surfaced rules), spec folder hierarchy awareness, cross-document entity linking, ANCHOR-based section retrieval (~93% token savings), dual-scope auto-surfacing on tool use and compression events, and provenance traces showing how each result was found.


#### INDEXING AND INFRASTRUCTURE

The memory engine watches the filesystem in real-time (chokidar), tracks content hashes for incremental indexing, retries failed embeddings in the background, falls back to lexical-only indexing when embedding services are unavailable, and uses atomic writes with crash recovery.


#### EVALUATION INFRASTRUCTURE

Research-grade evaluation: 12-metric computation (MRR, NDCG, MAP), a 110-question synthetic ground truth corpus, ablation studies measuring per-channel quality impact, and shadow scoring for testing ranking changes before deployment.


#### Embedding Providers

- **Voyage AI** — Set `VOYAGE_API_KEY` env var. Best quality, recommended.
- **OpenAI** — Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` env var. Strong alternative.
- **HuggingFace Local** — No setup needed. Free, auto-detected fallback.

For the full 222-feature pipeline, per-signal weights, FSRS formula, algorithm parameters and 33-tool API reference, see the [MCP Server README](.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/README.md).

### 3.6 GATE SYSTEM

3 mandatory gates run before any file change, defined in `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md`. Every request passes through the same sequence.

#### The 3 Gates

| Gate | Name | Type | What It Does |
|------|------|------|--------------|
| **Gate 1** | Understanding + Context Surfacing | SOFT BLOCK | Calls `memory_match_triggers()` to surface relevant prior context. Classifies intent as Research or Implementation. Applies dual-threshold: confidence >= 0.70 AND uncertainty <= 0.35 |
| **Gate 2** | Skill Routing | REQUIRED | Runs `skill_advisor.py` against the request. Confidence >= 0.8 means the skill must be loaded. Ensures the right domain expertise is always in context |
| **Gate 3** | Spec Folder | HARD BLOCK | Overrides Gates 1-2. Asks: A) Existing folder? B) New folder? C) Update related? D) Skip? E) Phase folder? No file changes without an answer |


#### How Requests Flow Through Gates

  │  Memory Save + Completion Verification   │
  └─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```


#### Post-Execution Rules

- **Memory Save** (HARD BLOCK) — Triggered by "save context" or `/memory:save`. Must use `generate-context.js` -- no manual memory file creation.
- **Completion Verification** (HARD BLOCK) — Triggered by claiming "done" or "complete". Must load `checklist.md` and verify ALL items with evidence.


#### Analysis Lenses

Applied silently during gate processing on every request:

- **CLARITY** — Is this the simplest solution? Are abstractions earned?
- **SYSTEMS** — What does this touch? What are the side effects?
- **BIAS** — Is the user solving a symptom? Is the framing correct?
- **SUSTAINABILITY** — Will future developers understand this?
- **VALUE** — Does this change behavior or just refactor?
- **SCOPE** — Does solution complexity match problem size?

Full gate definitions and anti-pattern detection rules are in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).

### 3.7 CODE MODE MCP

Code Mode MCP gives the AI access to external tools (Figma, GitHub, Chrome DevTools, ClickUp, Webflow) through a single TypeScript execution interface. Instead of loading 47 tool definitions into context (141k tokens), Code Mode loads them on demand through one interface (1.6k tokens) -- a 98.7% reduction.


#### Native MCP Servers

Defined in `opencode.json`:

| Server | Tools | Purpose |
|--------|-------|---------|
| `spec_kit_memory` | 33 | Cognitive memory system -- the memory engine |
| `code_mode` | 7 | External tool orchestration via TypeScript execution |
| `cocoindex_code` | 1 | Semantic code search via vector embeddings |
| `sequential_thinking` | 1 | Structured multi-step reasoning for complex problems |
| **Total** | **42** | |

#### Code Mode Tools (7)

- **`search_tools`** — Discover relevant tools by task description
- **`tool_info`** — Get complete tool parameters and TypeScript interface
- **`call_tool_chain`** — Execute TypeScript code with access to all registered tools
- **`list_tools`** — List all currently registered tool names
- **`register_manual`** — Register a new tool provider
- **`deregister_manual`** — Remove a tool provider
- **`get_required_keys_for_tool`** — Check required environment variables for a tool

#### External Integrations (via `.utcp_config.json`)

- **`chrome_devtools_1`** (MCP/stdio) — Browser automation (instance 1). No env var needed.
- **`chrome_devtools_2`** (MCP/stdio) — Browser automation (instance 2). No env var needed.
- **`clickup`** (MCP/stdio) — Task management, goals, docs. Requires `CLICKUP_API_KEY`.
- **`figma`** (MCP/stdio) — Design files, components, exports. Requires `FIGMA_API_KEY`.
- **`github`** (MCP/stdio) — Issues, pull requests, commits. Requires `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN`.
- **`webflow`** (MCP/remote) — Sites, CMS collections. Requires Webflow auth.


#### Performance

| Metric | Without Code Mode | With Code Mode |
|--------|-------------------|----------------|
| Context tokens | 141k (47 tools loaded) | 1.6k (on-demand) |
| Round trips | 15+ for chained operations | 1 (TypeScript chain) |
| Type safety | None | Full TypeScript |
| Context reduction | -- | 98.7% |

To call a Code Mode tool: `call_tool_chain({ typescript: "const result = await figma.figma_get_file({fileKey: 'abc123'}); return result;" })`

## 4. CONFIGURATION

### Core Configuration Files

- **`CLAUDE.md`** — Gate definitions, behavior rules, coding anti-patterns. Used by Claude Code (primary runtime).
- **`AGENTS.md`** — Agent routing, capability reference, gate documentation. Used by all runtimes.
- **`opencode.json`** — MCP server bindings (4 servers), model configuration. Used by OpenCode platform.
- **`.utcp_config.json`** — Code Mode external tool registrations. Used by `mcp-code-mode` skill.
- **`.claude/mcp.json`** — Claude Code MCP configuration. Claude Code only.
- **`.gemini/settings.json`** — Gemini CLI configuration. Gemini CLI only.

### Memory Engine Configuration

The memory server reads configuration from environment variables:

- **`VOYAGE_API_KEY`** (optional) — Voyage AI embeddings (recommended)
- **`OPENAI_API_KEY`** (optional) — OpenAI embeddings (alternative)
- **`MEMORY_DB_PATH`** (optional) — Override default database path

Default database path: `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/shared/mcp_server/database/context-index.sqlite`

> [!TIP]
> If no API key is set, the memory engine auto-detects **HuggingFace Local** embeddings -- free, no setup required.

### Memory Feature Flags

26+ feature flags control search channels, scoring signals and infrastructure components. All default to sensible values.

- **Search Pipeline** — BM25, Graph channel, Reranker, MMR, Co-Activation, FSRS decay, Interference penalty. All enabled by default.
- **Session/Cache** — Working memory, TTL cache, Session deduplication. All enabled by default.
- **Memory/Storage** — Auto-promotion, Negative feedback, Content normalization. All enabled by default.
- **Embedding/API** — Voyage AI, OpenAI, HuggingFace Local (auto-detected). Provider-dependent.
- **Debug** — Trace mode, Scoring observability, Shadow evaluation. All disabled by default.

For the complete flag reference with per-flag defaults, see [MCP Server README Section 5](.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/README.md#5-configuration).

### Database Schema

The memory system uses a SQLite database with 25 tables:

- **Core** (3) — `memories`, `embeddings`, `memory_sections`
- **Search** (3) — `fts_memories`, `bm25_index`, `search_cache`
- **Graph** (3) — `causal_edges`, `communities`, `co_activations`
- **Lifecycle** (3) — `memory_states`, `validation_feedback`, `promotions`
- **Session** (2) — `working_memory`, `session_events`
- **Shared** (3) — `shared_spaces`, `memberships`, `kill_switches`
- **Evaluation** (3) — `eval_runs`, `ablation_results`, `ground_truth`

## 5. FAQ

**Q: Do I need all 18 skills installed to use the framework?**

A: No. Skills are loaded on demand by Gate 2. You only need the ones relevant to your work. The two core skills -- `system-spec-kit` and `sk-doc` -- cover most documentation workflows. The MCP and cross-AI CLI skills require additional API keys or tools.

---

**Q: Is this only for OpenCode, or does it work with other runtimes?**

A: It works with OpenCode, Codex CLI, Claude Code and Gemini CLI. Agent definitions are mirrored across all four runtime directories. Each runtime has its own adapter files that translate the source-of-truth definitions into the format that runtime expects.

---

**Q: What happens if I do not use a spec folder?**

A: Gate 3 blocks file modifications until a spec folder answer is provided. You can skip it with option D, but skipped sessions are undocumented and will not be recoverable via memory search. For trivial changes under 5 characters in a single file, Gate 3 does not trigger.

---

**Q: How does the memory system know what is relevant to my current task?**

A: Memory files have YAML frontmatter with tags and trigger phrases. When you start a session, `memory_match_triggers()` runs a 5-channel hybrid search and returns the top matches, classified by intent and fused with RRF.

---

**Q: Can I use this framework without the cognitive memory features?**

A: Yes. The Spec Kit documentation workflow (Gate 3, spec folders, templates) works independently of the memory MCP server. You will not have cross-session memory retrieval, but you will still get structured documentation, agent routing and skill loading.

---

**Q: How do I add a new skill to the framework?**

A: Use `/create:sk-skill` to scaffold the skill structure. The command creates the `SKILL.md`, references and assets directories following the `sk-doc` template. Then register the skill in `.opencode/skill/README.md`.

---

**Q: What does "local-first" mean for the memory system?**

A: The memory database is a SQLite file on your local machine. No session data, code or context is sent to any external service unless you configure a cloud embedding provider (Voyage AI or OpenAI). HuggingFace Local embeddings run entirely on-device.

---

**Q: How do I contribute a new agent definition?**

A: Define the agent in `.opencode/agent/` (the source of truth), then copy the adapter to `.claude/agents/`, `.codex/agents/` and `.gemini/agents/`. Use `/create:agent` to scaffold the file from the agent template.

---

**Q: How many MCP tools are there and where are they defined?**

A: 42 total across 4 native MCP servers: 33 memory tools (spec_kit_memory), 7 code mode tools, 1 semantic code search tool (cocoindex_code) and 1 sequential thinking tool. All server bindings are defined in `opencode.json`. The 33 memory tool definitions live in `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/tool-schemas.ts`.

---

**Q: What is the feature catalog?**

A: The feature catalog is a 255-entry reference across 21 categories documenting every capability of the memory system. It comes in two versions: a technical reference and a simple-terms companion with plain-language explanations. Both are in `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/feature_catalog/`.
