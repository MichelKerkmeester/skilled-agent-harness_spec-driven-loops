## 1. DURABLE DIRECTIVE

**Objective:** Leave `/doctor:speckit skill-budget` in a state that matches the current system: kept, fixed or retired on evidence from this checkout.

### Decisions

Frozen choices. Changing one is an amendment.

| ID | Decision |
|----|----------|
| D1 | The verdict rests on what this checkout does, shown by command output or file:line, never on what a doc says. |
| D2 | A defect found in the subsystem the doctor inspects is recorded as a finding, not fixed in this phase. |
| D3 | Retiring a target removes its route and its workflow asset and changes nothing else. |

## 3. COMPLETION CRITERIA

- [ ] `scratch/reality-check.md` marks every path, script, command, flag and environment variable named by `doctor-skill-budget.yaml` as present, moved or missing
- [ ] `scratch/doctor-run.log` holds the output of one read-only or dry-run run of `/doctor:speckit skill-budget` on this checkout
- [ ] `implementation-summary.md` states one verdict, keep, fix or retire, and the evidence behind it
- [ ] `bash .skilled/commands/doctor/scripts/route-validate.sh` exits 0 after the verdict is applied
- [ ] `acceptance-criteria.md` shows every row as Met, Waived or Superseded
