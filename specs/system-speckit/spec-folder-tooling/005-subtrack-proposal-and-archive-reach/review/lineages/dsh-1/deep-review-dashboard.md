<!-- /ANCHOR:search-debt -->
<!-- ANCHOR:next-focus -->
## 11. NEXT FOCUS
- Dimension: synthesis - Focus area: compile the review report from the active registry, keep the six P1 and six P2 findings, record the max-iteration stop reason, and state the no-change surfaces. - Reason: the review reached its fifth and final scheduled iteration; the remaining work is synthesis and provenance, not another discovery pass. - Required evidence: registry, all five iteration narratives, current command README, and the terminal closeout event.

<!-- /ANCHOR:next-focus -->
<!-- ANCHOR:active-risks -->
## 12. ACTIVE RISKS
- 6 active P1 finding(s) — required before release; not a P0 but still blocks PASS.
