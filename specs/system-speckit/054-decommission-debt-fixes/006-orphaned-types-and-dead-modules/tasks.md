# Tasks: Phase 6: orphaned-types-and-dead-modules

<!-- SPECKIT_LEVEL: 2 -->

<!-- ANCHOR:notation -->
## Task Notation

| Prefix | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `[ ]` | Pending |
| `[x]` | Completed |
| `[P]` | Parallelizable |
| `[B]` | Blocked |

**Task Format**: `T### [P?] Description (file path)`
<!-- /ANCHOR:notation -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:phase-1 -->
## Phase 1: Setup

- [ ] T001 Capture baseline typecheck output for `shared`, `scripts`, `runtime`
- [ ] T002 [P] Capture baseline `check-markdown-links.cjs` output (counts and full broken list)
- [ ] T003 [P] `rg` each of the seven `shared/types.ts` symbols and both runtime modules across the whole repository (source and `specs/`) to confirm zero non-declaration reference
<!-- /ANCHOR:phase-1 -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:phase-2 -->
## Phase 2: Implementation

- [ ] T004 Delete or re-home (with a stated reason) the seven orphaned symbols in `shared/types.ts`, including any individual re-export in `shared/index.ts`
- [ ] T005 Delete or re-home (with a stated reason) `runtime/lib/cognitive/rollout-policy.ts` and its dedicated test
- [ ] T006 Delete or re-home (with a stated reason) `runtime/lib/description/repair.ts` and its dedicated tests
- [ ] T007 Move or delete `scripts/lib/completion-state.test.mjs` so it either runs under a real vitest include glob or is gone
- [ ] T008 Move or delete `runtime/scripts/tests/resource-map-extractor.vitest.ts` so it either runs under `runtime/vitest.config.ts`'s include globs or is gone
- [ ] T009 Add a log line or a reason comment to `alignment-validator.ts:582-586`'s empty catch
- [ ] T010 Deduplicate `check-markdown-links.cjs:24-26`'s `ROOTS` array
<!-- /ANCHOR:phase-2 -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:phase-3 -->
## Phase 3: Verification

- [ ] T011 Re-run typecheck for `shared`, `scripts`, `runtime` and confirm no new error versus the T001 baseline
- [ ] T012 Re-run `check-markdown-links.cjs` and confirm its counts reflect the deduplicated file set, and its `broken` list is unchanged in content from the T002 baseline
- [ ] T013 Run `vitest run` and confirm the two previously-orphaned tests either appear in the executed-file list or are confirmed deleted, with no new failure
<!-- /ANCHOR:phase-3 -->

<!-- ANCHOR:fix-completeness -->
## Fix Completeness

- [ ] CHK-FIX-001 [P0] Each actionable finding has a finding class: `instance-only`, `class-of-bug`, `cross-consumer`, `algorithmic`, `matrix/evidence`, or `test-isolation`.
- [ ] CHK-FIX-002 [P0] Same-class producer inventory completed, or instance-only status proven by grep.
- [ ] CHK-FIX-003 [P0] Consumer inventory completed for changed helpers, policies, schema fields, response fields, docs, and tests.
- [ ] CHK-FIX-004 [P0] Security/path/parser/redaction fixes include adversarial table tests for delimiter, joined-input, outside-root, no-op, and fallback cases.
- [ ] CHK-FIX-005 [P1] Matrix axes and row count are listed before completion is claimed.
- [ ] CHK-FIX-006 [P1] Hostile env/global-state variant executed when tests or code read process-wide state.
- [ ] CHK-FIX-007 [P1] Evidence is pinned to a fix SHA or explicit diff range, not a moving branch-relative range.
