# Implementation Summary

<!-- SPECKIT_LEVEL: 2 -->
<!-- HVR_REFERENCE: .skilled/skills/sk-doc/sk-create-with-human-voice/references/hvr-rules.md -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:metadata -->
## Metadata
<!-- FILL: Fill the folder name, the completion date and the level. Use the real date. GOOD: `004-rotate-logs-keep`. Completed 2026-10-24. Level 1. WEAK: Folder: TBD. -->

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Spec Folder** | 001-step-order-acceptance-after-development |
| **Completed** | 2026-11-14 |
| **Level** | 2 |
<!-- /ANCHOR:metadata -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:what-built -->
## What Was Built
<!-- FILL: Open with the user-visible change in two sentences, then list each changed file. GOOD: `--keep 3` leaves three archives in `logs/archive`. A plain run leaves all ten. WEAK: Implemented the feature. -->

[YOUR_VALUE_HERE: Opening hook: 2-3 sentences on what changed and why it matters. Lead with impact.]

### Phase 1: step-order-acceptance-after-development

[What this feature does and why it exists. 1-2 paragraphs. Use direct address.
Explain what the user gains, not what files you touched.]

### Files Changed

| File | Action | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| [YOUR_VALUE_HERE: path] | [YOUR_VALUE_HERE: Created/Modified/Deleted] | [YOUR_VALUE_HERE: What this change accomplishes] |
<!-- /ANCHOR:what-built -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:how-delivered -->
## How It Was Delivered
<!-- FILL: Name the commands that proved it and the order they ran. GOOD: Ran `--keep 3` and a plain run, then the suite. All three passed. WEAK: Tested and shipped. -->

[YOUR_VALUE_HERE: How was this tested, verified and shipped? What was the rollout approach?]
<!-- /ANCHOR:how-delivered -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:decisions -->
## Key Decisions
<!-- FILL: Write one decision per row. Give the reason, not the label. GOOD: Option over environment variable: one run can pick a different count without editing config. WEAK: Used the best approach. -->

| Decision | Why |
|----------|-----|
| [YOUR_VALUE_HERE: What was decided] | [YOUR_VALUE_HERE: Active-voice rationale with specific reasoning] |
<!-- /ANCHOR:decisions -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:verification -->
## Verification
<!-- FILL: Write one check per row with the exact output. GOOD: `ls logs/archive | wc -l` after `--keep 3`: 3. After a plain run: 10. Suite: PASSED. WEAK: All tests pass. -->

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| [YOUR_VALUE_HERE: Validation, lint, tests, manual check] | [YOUR_VALUE_HERE: PASS/FAIL with specifics] |
<!-- /ANCHOR:verification -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:limitations -->
## Known Limitations
<!-- FILL: Name one real limit and the workaround. GOOD: `--keep` deletes the older archives for good. Copy `logs/archive/` aside first when a run may cut too deep. WEAK: No limitations. -->

1. **[YOUR_VALUE_HERE: Limitation]** [YOUR_VALUE_HERE: Specific detail with workaround if one exists.]
