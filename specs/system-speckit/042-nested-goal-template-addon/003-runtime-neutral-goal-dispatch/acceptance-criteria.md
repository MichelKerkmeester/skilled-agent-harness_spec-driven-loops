# Acceptance Criteria: Runtime-Neutral Goal Dispatch

<!-- SPECKIT_TEMPLATE_SOURCE: acceptance-criteria | v2.2 -->
<!-- HVR_REFERENCE: .opencode/skills/sk-doc/shared/references/hvr-rules.md -->

> This document decides whether the packet may close. A packet is closeable when
> every row below is `Met`, `Waived` or `Superseded`. A `Waived` or `Superseded`
> row MUST name an ADR that exists in `decision-record.md`.

## 1. METADATA

**Packet:** system-speckit/042-nested-goal-template-addon/003-runtime-neutral-goal-dispatch
**Level:** 2
**Status:** Draft
**Date:** 2026-08-29
<!-- /ANCHOR:metadata -->

<!-- ANCHOR:criteria -->
## 2. CRITERIA

One row per criterion. `AC-ID` is stable once written: supersede a criterion, never renumber it.

| AC-ID | REQ | Given / When / Then | Verification | Status | Waiver |
|-------|-----|---------------------|--------------|--------|--------|
| AC-001 | REQ-001 | Given the set action, When it dispatches, Then it resolves by runtime rather than naming one runtime's tool unconditionally | Six workflow assets carry `dispatch_by_runtime` instead of one named tool | Met | - |
| AC-002 | REQ-002 | Given the offer action, When it runs, Then it calls no tool | Offer and skip wording now says no goal tool is called in any runtime | Met | - |
| AC-003 | REQ-003 | Given a command file naming the goal document, When the contract test runs, Then it passes | Control: a command file naming the goal document exits 0 | Met | - |
| AC-004 | REQ-004 | Given a genuinely stale command reference, When the contract test runs, Then it still fails | Control: a stale `commands/goal.md` reference exits 1 | Met | - |
| AC-005 | REQ-005 | Given a runtime that documents no adapter, When the set action resolves, Then it hands off rather than fabricating one | The dispatch table hands off for runtimes documenting no adapter | Met | - |

### Status values

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `Met` | Verified. The Verification cell names evidence that was actually observed. |
| `Unmet` | Not yet satisfied. Blocks closure. |
| `Waived` | Deliberately not pursued. Requires an ADR in the Waiver cell. |
| `Superseded` | Replaced by a different criterion or decision. Requires an ADR in the Waiver cell. |

### Waiver cell

Write `-` when the row is `Met` or `Unmet`. Write `ADR-NNN` when the row is
`Waived` or `Superseded`, naming a decision record that exists in
`decision-record.md`. A waiver naming an ADR that is not there fails validation:
the point of a waiver is that someone recorded the reasoning, so an unbacked
waiver is treated as an unmet criterion rather than as a pass.

## 3. CLOSURE STATEMENT

**Closeable:** Yes

All five criteria met. Both directions of the assertion change were proven: a spec-document reference passes and a stale command reference still fails.
