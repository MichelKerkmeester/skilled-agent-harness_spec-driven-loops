# Tasks: Manifest Entry and Goal Template

<!-- SPECKIT_LEVEL: 2 -->
<!-- SPECKIT_TEMPLATE_SOURCE: tasks-core | v2.2 -->

<!-- ANCHOR:notation -->
## Task Notation

| Prefix | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `[ ]` | Pending |
| `[x]` | Completed |
| `[P]` | Parallelizable |
| `[B]` | Blocked |

**Task Format**: `T### [P?] Description (file path)`
<!-- /ANCHOR:notation -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:phase-1 -->
## Phase 1: Setup

- [x] T001 Confirm which contract buckets the document collector walks - lazy is spread, optional is skipped (`mcp-server/lib/validation/spec-doc-structure.ts:206`)
- [x] T002 Confirm the gate syntax and the level ids the renderer accepts - gate syntax `IF level:` with an explicit level list
- [x] T003 [P] Capture the current per-level document sets as a before-state - `template-structure.js docs <level>` returned the core trio at every level, before and after
<!-- /ANCHOR:phase-1 -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:phase-2 -->
## Phase 2: Implementation

- [x] T004 Author the gated template with its durable, binding and log sections - `templates/addons/goal.md.tmpl`
- [x] T005 Declare the document, its version and its section gates in the contract - `templates/spec-kit-docs.json` documents, versions and section gates
- [x] T006 List the document as a lazy add-on at Levels 1, 2, 3, 3+ and phase - lazyAddonDocs at 1/2/3/3+/phase
- [x] T007 Add the document-to-template mapping so drift is detectable - `scripts/utils/template-structure.js` document-to-template map
<!-- /ANCHOR:phase-2 -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:phase-3 -->
## Phase 3: Verification

- [x] T008 Render at every level and confirm the five carrying levels emit and the rest do not - 53/53/53/53/68 lines, 0 at review
- [x] T009 Probe the resolver for a path at the carrying levels and null elsewhere - path at 1/2/3/3+/phase, null at review (`scripts/utils/template-structure.js:99`)
- [x] T010 Scaffold a packet at a carrying level and confirm the document arrives - authored into this packet's parent (`../goal.md`)

- [ ] CHK-FIX-004 [P0] Security/path/parser/redaction fixes include adversarial table tests for delimiter, joined-input, outside-root, no-op, and fallback cases.
- [ ] CHK-FIX-005 [P1] Matrix axes and row count are listed before completion is claimed.
- [ ] CHK-FIX-006 [P1] Hostile env/global-state variant executed when tests or code read process-wide state.
- [ ] CHK-FIX-007 [P1] Evidence is pinned to a fix SHA or explicit diff range, not a moving branch-relative range.
