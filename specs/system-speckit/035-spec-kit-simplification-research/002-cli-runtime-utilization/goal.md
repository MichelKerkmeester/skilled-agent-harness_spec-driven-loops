# Goal: CLI runtime utilization

<!-- SPECKIT_TEMPLATE_SOURCE: goal | v2.2 -->
<!-- HVR_REFERENCE: .opencode/skills/sk-doc/sk-create-with-human-voice/references/hvr-rules.md -->

> Everything above the log is DURABLE: it is what an operator sets as the session
> objective, and it must stay true for the life of the packet. Keep it short —
> the runtime goal surfaces cap what they will hold, and a truncated objective
> loses its tail, which is where the completion criteria live.

<!-- ANCHOR:directive -->
## 1. DURABLE DIRECTIVE

**Objective:** Establish what every directory of the @spec-kit/cli package is for, who actually calls it, what is dead or test-only, and what should be removed or merged.

### Decisions

Frozen choices. Changing one is an amendment.

| ID | Decision |
|----|----------|
| D1 | Research is read-only; remediation lands in a sibling child created after synthesis |
| D2 | A directory counts as live only with a caller outside the package or a registered entry point |
| D3 | Naming is judged against observed callers, not the README |

### Operator copy

The operator holds this directive as the session objective, and that copy is
what judges completion, not this file. Whenever anything above the log changes
(objective, a decision, the binding table, a criterion), resend the full text
of this file in chat so the operator can update their copy. A child goal change
that alters a parent decision or criterion is an amendment to the parent: apply
it there first, then resend the parent.

## 3. COMPLETION CRITERIA

Three to seven bullets, each checkable without opening another file. Copy them
verbatim into the objective: nothing dereferences a path, so criteria left only
here are invisible to whatever judges completion.

- [ ] 10 iteration files and 10 state events exist under research/lineages/glm-5-3-flash-cli-runtime/
- [ ] research.md carries a per-directory table: purpose, callers, verdict
- [ ] Every P0 and P1 finding reproduces in-session
- [ ] A ranked removal and merge list with the evidence that nothing documented depends on each item

## 4. LOG

Everything below is VOLATILE. It is not part of the directive, it is not copied
into the objective, and it is expected to grow. Progress, evidence, deviations
and findings belong here.

### Progress

| Item | State | Evidence |
|------|-------|----------|
| Packet opened | Done | this file |

### Deviations and findings

| Item | Note |
|------|------|
| None yet | - |
