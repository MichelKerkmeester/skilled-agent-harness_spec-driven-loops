# Tasks: Prove the repair write reaches the file the scan classified, and retire the containment branch that proves nothing

<!-- SPECKIT_LEVEL: 2 -->

<!-- ANCHOR:notation -->
## Task Notation

| Prefix | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `[ ]` | Pending |
| `[x]` | Completed |
| `[P]` | Parallelizable |
| `[B]` | Blocked |

**Task Format**: `T### [P?] Description (file path)`
<!-- /ANCHOR:notation -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:phase-1 -->
## Phase 1: Setup

- [ ] T001 [P0] Add the directory-swap case to the repair suite and observe it write through against current code
- [ ] T002 [P0] Record what the scan observes per candidate, and whether it survives to the write
- [ ] T003 [P1] Identify a real symlinked track to exercise, rather than relying on a fixture
<!-- /ANCHOR:phase-1 -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:phase-2 -->
## Phase 2: Implementation

- [ ] T004 [P0] Carry the scan-time observation forward to the write
- [ ] T005 [P0] Compare handle identity after opening, and refuse on mismatch
- [ ] T006 [P0] Refuse rather than fall back when identity cannot be established
- [x] T007 [P1] Remove the root source measured to change no outcome — suite 8/8 after, 4/8 with the guard neutered
- [x] T008 [P1] Add the containment case that pins what defeats the guard
<!-- /ANCHOR:phase-2 -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:phase-3 -->
## Phase 3: Verification

- [ ] T009 [P0] Directory swap is refused and the victim file is byte-identical
- [ ] T010 [P0] A legitimate repair inside a real symlinked track still succeeds
- [ ] T011 [P0] Final-component swap is still refused
- [x] T012 [P1] Containment suite passes with one root source
- [ ] T013 [P1] Correct the predecessor packets' records where they overstate what is bounded
<!-- /ANCHOR:phase-3 -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:completion -->
## Completion Criteria

- [ ] Every P0 task above is checked with observed evidence
- [ ] Every row in `acceptance-criteria.md` is `Met`, `Waived` or `Superseded`
- [ ] `validate.sh --strict` reports `RESULT: PASSED`
- [ ] Every added test case was observed failing before its fix
<!-- /ANCHOR:completion -->

<!-- ANCHOR:fix-completeness -->
## Fix Completeness

- [ ] CHK-FIX-001 [P0] Each actionable finding has a finding class: `instance-only`, `class-of-bug`, `cross-consumer`, `algorithmic`, `matrix/evidence`, or `test-isolation`.
- [ ] CHK-FIX-002 [P0] Same-class producer inventory completed, or instance-only status proven by grep.
- [ ] CHK-FIX-003 [P0] Consumer inventory completed for changed helpers, policies, schema fields, response fields, docs, and tests.
- [ ] CHK-FIX-004 [P0] Security/path/parser/redaction fixes include adversarial table tests for delimiter, joined-input, outside-root, no-op, and fallback cases.
- [ ] CHK-FIX-005 [P1] Matrix axes and row count are listed before completion is claimed.
- [ ] CHK-FIX-006 [P1] Hostile env/global-state variant executed when tests or code read process-wide state.
- [ ] CHK-FIX-007 [P1] Evidence is pinned to a fix SHA or explicit diff range, not a moving branch-relative range.
