title: "Implementation Plan: Repair Write Symlink Refusal"
description: "The repair script decided a path was a regular file during its scan and wrote it later. The write now refuses to traverse a symlink itself. Also records why the sibling resume-containment finding was declined: its remedy would break every symlinked track."
trigger_phrases:
  - "repair write symlink plan"
  - "writeExistingFileNoFollow helper"
  - "open with traversal disabled"
  - "named refusal not raw errno"
  - "graph metadata repair write path"
