# Implementation Plan: Restore scaffold values a spec document lost, only where the right value can be proven

<!-- SPECKIT_LEVEL: 2 -->

<!-- ANCHOR:summary -->
## 1. SUMMARY

### Technical Context

| Aspect | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Language/Stack** | Node CommonJS over Markdown frontmatter |
| **Framework** | The spec-kit CLI |
| **Storage** | None |
| **Testing** | A proof packet taken from FAILED to PASSED, then a before-and-after over five tracks |

### Overview
The whole design rests on one distinction the existing tooling never drew: a value defined literally by a template is recoverable, and a value a person wrote for one packet is not. Restoring the first is not authoring. The healer therefore carries the template defaults as literals and writes them only into fields that are present and empty. For the template-source header it goes further and demands evidence from the document itself, matching its anchors against the template anchor set, so naming the template is a finding rather than a claim.

## 2. QUALITY GATES

### Definition of Ready
- [ ] Problem statement clear and scope documented
- [ ] Success criteria measurable
- [ ] Dependencies identified

### Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Tests passing (if applicable)
- [ ] Docs updated (spec/plan/tasks)

## 3. ARCHITECTURE

### Pattern
A dry-run-first repair tool whose refusals are as load-bearing as its fixes.

### Key Components
- **Template defaults**: literal values copied from each document class template, never composed
- **Anchor signatures**: the evidence that lets the tool name a template without asserting anything

### Data Flow
Discover packets, read each document, restore an empty field from its template default, name the template when the anchors prove it, and report every refusal with the evidence that was missing. Writing requires an explicit flag.

## FIX ADDENDUM: AFFECTED SURFACES

Use this section when `research_intent=fix_bug`, when planning from a deep-review FAIL/CONDITIONAL verdict, or when any finding touches security, path handling, env precedence, schema boundaries, persistence, public responses, or shared policy.

| Surface | Current Role | Action | Verification |
|---------|--------------|--------|--------------|
| [producer/helper/policy] | [what owns the behavior] | [update/unchanged/not a consumer] | [grep/test/doc evidence] |
| [consumer/status/docs/tests] | [how it observes the behavior] | [update/unchanged/not a consumer] | [grep/test/doc evidence] |

Required inventories:
- Same-class producers: `rg -n '<field|string|helper|literal|error-pattern>' <module-or-files>`.
- Consumers of changed symbols: `rg -n '<changedSymbol>|<changedConstant>|<changedPublicField>' . --glob '*.ts' --glob '*.js' --glob '*.md'`.
- Matrix axes: list every independent input axis and the required rows before implementation.
- Algorithm invariant: for path/redaction/parser/resolver/security fixes, state the invariant and adversarial cases.

## L2: ENHANCED ROLLBACK

### Pre-deployment Checklist
- [ ] Backup created (if data changes)
- [ ] Feature flag configured
- [ ] Monitoring alerts set

### Rollback Procedure
1. [Immediate action - e.g., disable feature flag]
2. [Revert code - e.g., git revert or redeploy previous version]
3. [Verify rollback - e.g., smoke test critical paths]
4. [Notify stakeholders - if user-facing]

### Data Reversal
- **Has data migrations?** [Yes/No]
- **Reversal procedure**: [Steps or "N/A"]
