> Everything between the frontmatter and the log is the DURABLE SLICE: it is
> what an operator sets as the session objective, and it must stay true for the
> life of the packet. The frontmatter above it is bookkeeping and never leaves
> this file: it is not sent in chat, not injected, not stored in an objective.
> Keep the slice short. A phase parent or top-level packet warns past 3000
> characters and fails past 4000, measured from the frontmatter's closing fence
> to the log anchor; the runtime goal surfaces cap what they hold, and a
> truncated objective loses its tail, which is where the criteria live.

<!-- ANCHOR:directive -->
## 1. DURABLE DIRECTIVE

**Objective:** [One sentence. What this packet is for. Not how, not progress.]

### Decisions

Frozen choices. Changing one is an amendment.

| ID | Decision |
|----|----------|
| D1 | [The decision, stated so a reader can tell whether work honors it] |

### Operator copy

The operator holds this directive as the session objective, and that copy is
what judges completion, not this file. Whenever anything above the log changes
(objective, a decision, the binding table, a criterion), resend the durable
slice of this file in chat, frontmatter excluded, so the operator can update
their copy. Keep reminding while it stays unset; never stop work for it. A
child goal change that alters a parent decision or criterion is an amendment
to the parent: apply it there first, then resend the parent.

## 3. COMPLETION CRITERIA

Three to seven bullets, each checkable without opening another file. Copy them
verbatim into the objective: nothing dereferences a path, so criteria left only
here are invisible to whatever judges completion.

- [ ] [A check whose answer is an exit code, a count, or a named artifact]
- [ ] [Another]
- [ ] [Another]

## 4. LOG

Everything below is VOLATILE. It is not part of the directive, it is not copied
into the objective, and it is expected to grow. Progress, evidence, deviations
and findings belong here.

### Progress

| Item | State | Evidence |
|------|-------|----------|
| [Item] | [Pending/In Progress/Done] | [Command output, file:line, or artifact] |

### Deviations and findings

| Item | Note |
|------|------|
| [What diverged from the directive] | [Why, and what was done instead] |
