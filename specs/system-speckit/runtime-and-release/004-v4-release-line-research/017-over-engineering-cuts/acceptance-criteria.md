# Acceptance Criteria: Phase 17: over-engineering-cuts

<!-- HVR_REFERENCE: .skilled/skills/sk-doc/sk-create-with-human-voice/references/hvr-rules.md -->

> This document decides whether the packet may close. A packet is closeable when
> every row below is `Met`, `Waived` or `Superseded`. A `Waived` or `Superseded`
> row MUST name an ADR that exists in `decision-record.md`.

<!-- ANCHOR:metadata -->
## 1. METADATA
<!-- FILL: Fill the packet id, the level, the status and the date. GOOD: `004-rotate-logs-keep`. Level 1. Draft. 2026-10-24. WEAK: Packet TBD. -->

**Packet:** 017-over-engineering-cuts
**Level:** 2
**Status:** Complete
**Date:** 2026-11-09
<!-- /ANCHOR:metadata -->

<!-- ANCHOR:criteria -->
## 2. CRITERIA
<!-- FILL: Write one row per requirement. The Then clause names a command. GOOD: AC-001: When `--keep 3` runs, Then `ls logs/archive | wc -l` prints 3. WEAK: The feature works. -->

One row per criterion. `AC-ID` is stable once written: supersede a criterion, never renumber it. A new row takes the highest AC-ID plus one.

| AC-ID | REQ | Given / When / Then | Verification | Status | Waiver |
|-------|-----|---------------------|--------------|--------|--------|
| AC-001 | REQ-001 | Given the module and its suite deleted, When the deep-loop typecheck and suite run, Then both pass | typecheck exit 0, no output; 173 files, 2868 passed, 8 skipped (baseline 174 files, 2884; the deleted suite held 18 cases) | Met | - |
| AC-002 | REQ-002 | Given the cuts, When the repository outside `specs/` is scanned for each deleted name, Then nothing names a deleted path | `rg` for `branch-leases-waves`, `palette-sheet-ordered` and `palette-sheet-categorical` prints nothing after the verdict-baseline entry was dropped | Met | - |
| AC-003 | REQ-003 | Given the cuts and refreshed fixtures, When sk-design, sk-doc and retrieval checks run, Then each passes | package exit 0; parent check 0 warnings; guard all fresh; README manifest reproducible; verdict parity diff empty; retrieval 209 passed | Met | - |

### Status values

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `Met` | Verified. The Verification cell names evidence that was actually observed. |
| `Unmet` | Not yet satisfied. Blocks closure. |
| `Waived` | Deliberately not pursued. Requires an ADR in the Waiver cell. |
| `Superseded` | Replaced by a different criterion or decision. Requires an ADR in the Waiver cell. |

### Waiver cell

Write `-` when the row is `Met` or `Unmet`. Write `ADR-NNN` when the row is
`Waived` or `Superseded`, naming a decision record that exists in
`decision-record.md`. A waiver naming an ADR that is not there fails validation:
the point of a waiver is that someone recorded the reasoning, so an unbacked
waiver is treated as an unmet criterion rather than as a pass.

<!-- ANCHOR:closure -->
## 3. CLOSURE STATEMENT
<!-- FILL: Write Yes or No and one sentence. Name a criterion by its id only when it blocks closure. Never write a count of criteria or an id range, because every added row makes it wrong. GOOD: No. AC-002 is unmet. WEAK: All eight criteria AC-001 to AC-008 are met. -->

**Closeable:** Yes

Every criterion is met with observed evidence.
