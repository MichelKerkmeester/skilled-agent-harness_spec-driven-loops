# Tasks: Phase 8: write-containment-scoping

<!-- SPECKIT_LEVEL: 2 -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:notation -->
## Task Notation
<!-- FILL: Keep the prefix table and add the two shell variables this task list uses. GOOD: `R` is `scripts/rotate-logs.sh`. `L` is `.skilled/skills/system-deep-loop/runtime/lib/deep-loop/write-containment.ts`. `R` is `.skilled/skills/system-deep-loop/runtime`.
<!-- /ANCHOR:notation -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:phase-1 -->
## Phase 1: Setup
<!-- FILL: Replace the sample tasks with the real setup steps. Each task names a file and a verify command. GOOD: T001 Confirm `logs/archive/` holds 10 archives. Verify: `ls logs/archive | wc -l` prints 10. WEAK: T001 Set up the project. -->

- [x] T001 Take the runtime baseline from the phase 007 final gate (`R/tests`). Verify: 174 files, 2880 passed, 8 skipped recorded in `implementation-summary.md`.
<!-- /ANCHOR:phase-1 -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:phase-2 -->
## Phase 2: Implementation
<!-- FILL: Write one implementation task per file change. Add a `Verify:` line with the command and its expected output. GOOD: T002 Add the `--keep <n>` branch. Verify: `--keep 3` leaves 3 archives. WEAK: T002 Implement the feature. -->

- [x] T002 Move live-run discovery into `L` and apply it in snapshot and detection; fan-out calls it (`L`, `R/scripts/fanout-run.cjs`). Verify: live-sibling test reports no violation.
- [x] T003 Keep stale-lock and repo-root writes attributed (`L`). Verify: stale and repo-root tests report a violation.
- [x] T004 Pin that a new file in a new nested out-of-scope folder is recorded (`R/tests/unit/write-containment.vitest.ts`). Verify: nested-folder test passes.
<!-- /ANCHOR:phase-2 -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:phase-3 -->
## Phase 3: Verification
<!-- FILL: Write one verification task per requirement. Each one runs a command. GOOD: T003 Run both invocations. Verify: `ls logs/archive | wc -l` prints 3 and 10. WEAK: T003 Test everything. -->

- [x] T005 Rerun the runtime suite (`R/tests`). Verify: at least 2880 passed plus the new tests. Observed: 2884 passed, 8 skipped; council 118; typecheck exit 0.
- [x] T006 Cross-family review of the phase diff. Verify: verdict and adjudication in `decision-record.md`. Observed: DeepSeek CONDITIONAL, 3 P1 and 4 P2; 4 fixed, 3 accepted (D-10).
<!-- /ANCHOR:phase-3 -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:completion -->
## Completion Criteria
<!-- FILL: Keep the three completion lines and add the one artifact that proves the phase is done. GOOD: `--keep 3` leaves 3 archives and the suite passes. WEAK: Work is complete. -->

- [x] All tasks marked `[x]`
- [x] No `[B]` blocked tasks remaining
- [x] Manual verification passed
<!-- /ANCHOR:completion -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:cross-refs -->
## Cross-References
<!-- FILL: Name the spec and plan files. Add the decision record when the packet has one. GOOD: Specification: `spec.md`. Plan: `plan.md`. WEAK: See the other docs. -->

- **Specification**: See `spec.md`
- **Plan**: See `plan.md`
<!-- /ANCHOR:cross-refs -->

## Verification Checklist
<!-- FILL: Fill each checklist section below. GOOD: Each CHK line names the command that answers it. WEAK: The checklist is done. -->

<!-- ANCHOR:protocol -->
## Verification Protocol
<!-- FILL: Keep the three rows and add the rule this packet uses for a blocked task. GOOD: P0 blocks close. P1 needs a recorded reason. WEAK: Follow the priorities. -->

| Priority | Handling | Completion Impact |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| **[P0]** | HARD BLOCKER | Cannot claim done until complete |
| **[P1]** | Required | Must complete OR get user approval |
| **[P2]** | Optional | Can defer with documented reason |
<!-- /ANCHOR:protocol -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:pre-impl -->
## Pre-Implementation
<!-- FILL: Write one check per setup fact, each with a command. GOOD: CHK-001 [P0] The start commit is in `goal.md` section 4. WEAK: Setup is ready. -->

- [x] CHK-001 [P0] Requirements documented in spec.md
- [x] CHK-002 [P0] Technical approach defined in plan.md
- [x] CHK-003 [P1] Dependencies identified and available
<!-- /ANCHOR:pre-impl -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:code-quality -->
## Code Quality
<!-- FILL: Write one check per file rule. A command must answer it. GOOD: CHK-010 [P0] `bash -n scripts/rotate-logs.sh` exits 0. WEAK: Code is clean. -->

- [x] CHK-010 [P0] Code passes lint/format checks
- [x] CHK-011 [P0] No console errors or warnings

<!-- ANCHOR:testing -->
## Testing Checklist
<!-- FILL: Write one check per acceptance criterion. GOOD: CHK-020 [P0] `--keep 3` leaves 3 archives. WEAK: Tests pass. -->

- [x] CHK-020 [P0] All acceptance criteria met
- [x] CHK-021 [P0] Manual testing complete

<!-- ANCHOR:fix-completeness -->
## FIX ADDENDUM: FIX COMPLETENESS
<!-- FILL: Write this section when the packet fixes a reported finding. Delete it otherwise. GOOD: CHK-FIX-001 [P0] Every finding names one class. WEAK: All findings handled. -->

- [x] CHK-FIX-002 [P0] Same-class producer inventory completed, or instance-only status proven by grep.
- [x] CHK-FIX-003 [P0] Consumer inventory completed for changed helpers, policies, schema fields, response fields, docs, and tests.
- [x] CHK-FIX-004 [P0] Security/path/parser/redaction fixes include adversarial table tests for delimiter, joined-input, outside-root, no-op, and fallback cases.
- [x] CHK-FIX-005 [P1] Matrix axes and row count are listed before completion is claimed.
- [x] CHK-FIX-006 [P1] Hostile env/global-state variant executed when tests or code read process-wide state.
- [x] CHK-FIX-007 [P1] Evidence is pinned to a fix SHA or explicit diff range, not a moving branch-relative range.
<!-- /ANCHOR:fix-completeness -->

<!-- ANCHOR:summary -->
## Verification Summary
<!-- FILL: Count the boxes by priority and write the three totals. GOOD: P0 12, P1 13, P2 1. WEAK: Most items done. -->

| Category | Total | Verified |
|----------|-------|----------|
| P0 Items | 12 | 12/12 |
| P1 Items | 13 | 13/13 |
| P2 Items | 1 | 1/1 |

**Verification Date**: 2026-11-09. Evidence for each item is in `implementation-summary.md` (Verification and the baseline table). CHK-032 (auth) and CHK-042 (README) hold as N/A: the change touches no credential path and no README.

**Verification Date**: 2026-11-08
