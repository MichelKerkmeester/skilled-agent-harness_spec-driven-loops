<!-- ANCHOR:summary -->
## 1. SUMMARY

### Technical Context

| Aspect | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Language/Stack** | Files named in spec.md section 3 |
| **Framework** | The repository's own generators, hooks and validators |
| **Storage** | None |
| **Testing** | The checks in goal.md, rerun by the orchestrator |

### Overview
Add a runtimeRoot option to check() defaulting to the serving root, compare each traced file's bytes with the same relative path under it, and throw one error listing every mismatch after printing the closure.

## 2. QUALITY GATES

### Definition of Ready
- [x] Problem statement clear and scope documented
- [x] Success criteria measurable
- [x] Dependencies identified

### Definition of Done
- [x] All goal.md criteria pass on the orchestrator's rerun
- [x] Every new test failed once before its change
- [x] Strict validation passes

<!-- ANCHOR:architecture -->
## 3. ARCHITECTURE

### Pattern
In-place change to existing files; no new layer.

### Key Components
- **Orchestrator**: plans, makes each change, reruns every check and commits.

### Data Flow
One change, then the rerun of its check, then the next change or the phase close.

<!-- ANCHOR:phases -->
## 4. IMPLEMENTATION PHASES

Follow the ordered tasks in `tasks.md`. It owns the Setup, Implementation and Verification phase checkboxes and task state.
<!-- /ANCHOR:phases -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:testing -->
## 5. TESTING STRATEGY

The goal.md criteria are the tests. A new test is run once against the unchanged code first and must fail there.

<!-- ANCHOR:dependencies -->
## 6. DEPENDENCIES

None beyond the files named in spec.md.
<!-- /ANCHOR:dependencies -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:rollback -->
## 7. ROLLBACK PLAN

Revert this phase's commit. No other phase depends on its files.
