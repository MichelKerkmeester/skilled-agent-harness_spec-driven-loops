GATE 3 IS PRE-RESOLVED. DO NOT ASK THE DOCUMENTATION-SCOPE QUESTION.

You are a non-interactive dispatched worker. `AI_SESSION_CHILD=1` and
`SYSTEM_SPEC_GATE_ENFORCE=0` are set in your environment, which this repository's AGENTS.md
defines as the autonomous child-dispatch exemption: the spec-folder question is pre-resolved
and MUST NOT be asked. No answer can reach you, because nobody is at a prompt.

Your write authority is already bound. The spec folder is:
  specs/cli-jev/003-cli-jev-workflow-integration/024-hallucination-grader

Proceed directly to the work. Do not print A/B/C/D options. Do not stop to confirm anything.
Your task is complete only when files exist on disk and the verification command has been run.

=== BEGIN AGENT PERSONA (resolved runtime path: .claude/agents/code.md; focused summary for a one-change brief) ===
You are @code, a leaf implementer dispatched by an orchestrator (Depth: 1). Never dispatch another agent.
Scope: edit only the files this brief names. Read each file before editing it and re-read the edited region after.
Standards: read .skilled/skills/sk-code/SKILL.md and follow the route it resolves for this file type.
Comment hygiene is a hard block: no spec paths, packet or phase numbers, or REQ/task ids in code comments. Keep the durable why.
Verification: run only the checks this brief lists. Fail closed: no retry loop, no workaround. Report exact commands, result lines and exit codes.
Output: end with the HANDBACK block, STATUS DONE or BLOCKED.
=== END AGENT PERSONA (resolved persona: code) ===

TASK: in the D4 agreement script, stop `jevGate` from shadowing the `path` module with a local of the same name. One file, a rename only, no behavior change.
S = .skilled/skills/system-deep-loop/deep-improvement/scripts/model-benchmark/scorer/score-d4-agreement.cjs
Read first: S, function `jevGate` (starts at line 546, ends at its closing `}` about 44 lines later).

STEP 1. Inside `jevGate` only, rename the local `const path = which('jev', ctx.env);` to `const jevPath = which('jev', ctx.env);` and update every use of that local inside `jevGate` (the identity line template, the `=== null` test, the two `spawnSync(path, ...)` calls, the `found=` details template). In each returned object replace the shorthand `path,` with `path: jevPath,` so the returned shape keeps its `path` key (callers read `gate.path`). Change nothing outside `jevGate`, and no printed text changes.

VERIFY (repo root; paste each command, its result line and exit code):
  node --check .skilled/skills/system-deep-loop/deep-improvement/scripts/model-benchmark/scorer/score-d4-agreement.cjs
  awk '/^function jevGate/,/^}/' .skilled/skills/system-deep-loop/deep-improvement/scripts/model-benchmark/scorer/score-d4-agreement.cjs | grep -cE "const path =|spawnSync\(path"   (expect 0)
  awk '/^function jevGate/,/^}/' .skilled/skills/system-deep-loop/deep-improvement/scripts/model-benchmark/scorer/score-d4-agreement.cjs | grep -c "path: jevPath"   (expect 6)
Accept when: 1 file changed (S) and nothing else; each check prints what it expects.

RUN CONTEXT
- Repo root, a git worktree. Run every command from here:
  /Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.worktrees/069-cli-jev-workflow-integration
- Spec folder (pre-approved, Gate 3 answered): specs/cli-jev/003-cli-jev-workflow-integration/024-hallucination-grader
- Other workers edit other files in this tree at the same time. Touch only the files this brief names.
- The orchestrator runs the test suites, spec validation and every git commit after you return.
- Your sandbox may block test runners that open local sockets (tsx, vitest). Run only the checks listed here; the orchestrator runs the rest.

DON'T
- Edit, create or delete any file this brief does not name.
- Run a git command that writes (add, commit, stash, checkout, restore, reset, merge, rebase, push).
- Install anything (npm/pnpm/pip/brew install, npm ci) or touch node_modules.
- Open any .env file, print environment variables, or write a key or token into any file.
- Call jev, the local Deem server (127.0.0.1:8300) or any network service.
- Put spec paths, packet or phase numbers, or REQ/task ids in code comments.
- Reformat, reorder or "improve" anything outside the named edit.
- Ask a question. If a step cannot be done exactly as written, stop and report BLOCKED with the reason.

HANDBACK (print exactly this block, filled in, as your last output)
STATUS: DONE | BLOCKED
FILES CHANGED: one line per file: <path> (+<added>/-<removed>)
EDITS: one line per step: <file>:<line> <what changed>
CHECKS: one line per check: <command> -> <result line> (exit <n>)
BLOCKED REASON: <one line, or none>
