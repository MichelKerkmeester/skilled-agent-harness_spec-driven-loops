## 1. METADATA

**Packet:** cli-jev/003-cli-jev-workflow-integration/046-deem-deprecation/002-scorer-deem-arms
**Level:** 2
**Status:** Planned
**Date:** 2026-10-02
<!-- /ANCHOR:metadata -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:criteria -->
## 2. CRITERIA

One row per criterion. `AC-ID` is stable once written: supersede a criterion, never renumber it.

| AC-ID | REQ | Given / When / Then | Verification | Status | Waiver |
|-------|-----|---------------------|--------------|--------|--------|
| AC-001 | REQ-001 | Given the files 001 assigns to 002, When the Deem pattern is searched over them, Then only keep rows match | The grep in `goal.md` criterion 1 | Unmet | - |
| AC-002 | REQ-002 | Given each scorer and its recorded input, When the default run's stdout is compared before and after, Then `diff` is empty | `scratch/default-diff.txt` | Unmet | - |
| AC-003 | REQ-003 | Given every suite that covered a removed arm, When it runs from the final state, Then 0 fail | Each suite's output | Unmet | - |
| AC-004 | REQ-004 | Given each scorer, When it runs with `--deem`, Then it exits non-zero through its unknown-flag path | `scratch/deem-flag.txt` | Unmet | - |
| AC-005 | REQ-005 | Given the changes, When a reviewer from the other worker family reads them, Then no P0 or P1 stays open | The review output and `goal.md`'s log | Unmet | - |
| AC-006 | REQ-001 to REQ-005 | Given the final state, When the phase closes, Then `validate.sh --strict` prints `RESULT: PASSED` and `check-goal.cjs` prints `RESULT: PASSED (5/5 checks)` | `repair-derived.cjs --apply`, then both commands on this folder | Unmet | - |

### Status values

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `Met` | Verified. The Verification cell names evidence that was actually observed. |
| `Unmet` | Not yet satisfied. Blocks closure. |
| `Waived` | Deliberately not pursued. Requires an ADR in the Waiver cell. |
| `Superseded` | Replaced by a different criterion or decision. Requires an ADR in the Waiver cell. |

### Waiver cell

Write `-` when the row is `Met` or `Unmet`. Write `ADR-NNN` when the row is
`Waived` or `Superseded`, naming a decision record that exists in
`decision-record.md`. A waiver naming an ADR that is not there fails validation:
the point of a waiver is that someone recorded the reasoning, so an unbacked
waiver is treated as an unmet criterion rather than as a pass.

## 3. CLOSURE STATEMENT

**Closeable:** No

Every row is `Unmet` until its evidence is observed from the final state.
