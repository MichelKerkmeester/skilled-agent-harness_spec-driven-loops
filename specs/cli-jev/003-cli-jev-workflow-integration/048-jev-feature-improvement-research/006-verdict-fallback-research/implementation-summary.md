## What Was Built

Done. `research/research.md` ranks nine ways to improve, refine and expand the Jev reviewer verdict fallback. The headline: the 24/24 keep is real on a corpus built to be missed, but natural miss prevalence is unmeasured, so output capture and a zero-call census come before any integration.

### Phase 6: verdict-fallback-research

When this phase closes you can read ranked ways to improve, refine and expand the Jev reviewer verdict fallback in `research/research.md`.

### Files Changed

| File | Action | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| `spec.md` | Created | The research question and scope, plus the generated findings block |
| `research/research.md` | Created | Merged ranked research from both lineages |
| `research/lineages/` | Created | DeepSeek and Luna lineage state, iterations and reports |
| `research/findings-registry.json` | Created | Merged findings registry |

## How It Was Delivered

The `/deep:research` fan-out ran DeepSeek V4.1 Flash (max, cli-pi, 5 iterations) and GPT-6 Luna (max, fast, cli-codex, 3 iterations) side by side through `fanout-run.cjs`. The session then ran the command's synthesis phase: `fanout-merge.cjs`, the resource map, the merged `research.md`, `synthesis-closeout.cjs` and the spec findings writeback.

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Why |
|----------|-----|
| Two lineages from two model families | The operator asked for DeepSeek and Luna on every feature |

<!-- ANCHOR:verification -->
## Verification

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Iteration records | deepseek 5, luna 3 |
| Synthesis closeout | `synthesis_complete`, exit 0 |
| Session spot-checks | 8/8/8 label split, zero whole-word verdict tokens, same pick across orders on 24/24 rows (min pickProb 0.96), and five regex misses on plausible formats |
| `validate.sh --strict` | RESULT: PASSED |

<!-- ANCHOR:limitations -->
## Known Limitations

1. **Research only.** Nothing here changes a scorer or a live workflow.
