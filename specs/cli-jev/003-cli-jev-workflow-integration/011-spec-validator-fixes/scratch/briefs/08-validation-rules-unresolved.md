GATE 3 IS PRE-RESOLVED. DO NOT ASK THE DOCUMENTATION-SCOPE QUESTION.

You are a non-interactive dispatched worker. `AI_SESSION_CHILD=1` and
`SYSTEM_SPEC_GATE_ENFORCE=0` are set in your environment, which this repository's AGENTS.md
defines as the autonomous child-dispatch exemption: the spec-folder question is pre-resolved
and MUST NOT be asked. No answer can reach you, because nobody is at a prompt.

Your write authority is already bound. The spec folder is:
  specs/cli-jev/003-cli-jev-workflow-integration/011-spec-validator-fixes

Proceed directly to the work. Do not print A/B/C/D options. Do not stop to confirm anything.
Your task is complete only when files exist on disk and the verification command has been run.

=== BEGIN AGENT PERSONA (resolved runtime path: .claude/agents/markdown.md; focused summary for a one-change brief) ===
You are @markdown, a leaf documentation editor dispatched by an orchestrator (Depth: 1). Never dispatch another agent.
Scope: edit only the files this brief names. The orchestrator already applied sk-doc's rules when it wrote the new text, so apply it exactly as given.
Keep frontmatter, anchors, headings, tables and surrounding prose byte-identical outside the named edit.
Verification: run only the checks this brief lists and report exact commands, result lines and exit codes.
Output: end with the HANDBACK block, STATUS DONE or BLOCKED.
=== END AGENT PERSONA (resolved persona: markdown) ===

RUN CONTEXT
- Repo root, a git worktree. Run every command from here:
  /Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Code_Environment/Public/.worktrees/069-cli-jev-workflow-integration
- Spec folder (pre-approved, Gate 3 answered): specs/cli-jev/003-cli-jev-workflow-integration/011-spec-validator-fixes
- Other workers edit other files in this tree at the same time. Touch only the files this brief names.
- The orchestrator runs the test suites, spec validation and every git commit after you return.
- Your sandbox may block test runners that open local sockets (tsx, vitest). Run only the checks listed here; the orchestrator runs the rest.

DON'T
- Edit, create or delete any file this brief does not name.
- Run a git command that writes (add, commit, stash, checkout, restore, reset, merge, rebase, push).
- Install anything (npm/pnpm/pip/brew install, npm ci) or touch node_modules.
- Open any .env file, print environment variables, or write a key or token into any file.
- Call jev, the local Deem server (127.0.0.1:8300) or any network service.
- Put spec paths, packet or phase numbers, or REQ/task ids in code comments.
- Reformat, reorder or "improve" anything outside the named edit.
- Ask a question. If a step cannot be done exactly as written, stop and report BLOCKED with the reason.

STEP 1: name unresolved citations in the AC_COVERAGE paragraph
File: .skilled/skills/system-spec-kit/references/validation/validation-rules.md, line 95 (the paragraph that starts "`AC_COVERAGE` is registered at INFO severity").
Replace this exact text, which occurs once in the file:
manual-infeasible escape hatch status, and malformed evidence citations without adding strict warnings or errors.
with this exact text:
manual-infeasible escape hatch status, malformed evidence citations, and unresolved evidence citations without adding strict warnings or errors. A citation is unresolved when its file is not found as an absolute path, in the packet folder or under the repository root, or when its line is outside that file, and it still counts toward the covered count.
Everything else on line 95 and in the file stays byte-identical.
Accept when: 1 file changed, 1 line modified, 0 lines added or removed.

VERIFY (paste each command with its result line and exit code)
  grep -c 'nresolved' .skilled/skills/system-spec-kit/references/validation/validation-rules.md   # 1
  grep -c 'and malformed evidence citations without adding' .skilled/skills/system-spec-kit/references/validation/validation-rules.md   # 0
  git diff --numstat -- .skilled/skills/system-spec-kit/references/validation/validation-rules.md   # 1	1	<path>

HANDBACK (print exactly this block, filled in, as your last output)
STATUS: DONE | BLOCKED
FILES CHANGED: one line per file: <path> (+<added>/-<removed>)
EDITS: one line per step: <file>:<line> <what changed>
CHECKS: one line per check: <command> -> <result line> (exit <n>)
BLOCKED REASON: <one line, or none>
