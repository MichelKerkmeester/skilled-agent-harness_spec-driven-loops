# Acceptance Criteria: Phase 2: format-decision

<!-- HVR_REFERENCE: .opencode/skills/sk-doc/sk-create-with-human-voice/references/hvr-rules.md -->

> This document decides whether the packet may close. A packet is closeable when
> every row below is `Met`, `Waived` or `Superseded`. A `Waived` or `Superseded`
> row MUST name an ADR that exists in `decision-record.md`.

## 1. METADATA

**Packet:** sk-git/028-crawlable-commit-history/002-format-decision
**Level:** 3
**Status:** Complete
**Date:** 2026-09-11
<!-- /ANCHOR:metadata -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:criteria -->
## 2. CRITERIA

One row per criterion. `AC-ID` is stable once written: supersede a criterion, never renumber it.

| AC-ID | REQ | Given / When / Then | Verification | Status | Waiver |
|-------|-----|---------------------|--------------|--------|--------|
| AC-001 | REQ-001 | Given the research grammar, When a second model family reviews it, Then objections with evidence exist before the operator is asked | review returned 10 objections, each with a command or file:line | Met | - |
| AC-002 | REQ-002 | Given each decision, When read, Then alternatives and deciding evidence are named | decision-record.md, Alternatives Considered per ADR | Met | - |
| AC-003 | REQ-003 | Given the operator's answers, When recorded, Then each decision carries an approval row with a date | decision-record.md OPERATOR APPROVAL table, 2026-09-11 | Met | - |
| AC-004 | REQ-004 | Given the repo-rule question, When decided, Then the verdict names the router scope rule it rests on | ADR-005 context cites REPO RULES.md section 4 and blast-radius.md | Met | - |

### Status values

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `Met` | Verified. The Verification cell names evidence that was actually observed. |
| `Unmet` | Not yet satisfied. Blocks closure. |
| `Waived` | Deliberately not pursued. Requires an ADR in the Waiver cell. |
| `Superseded` | Replaced by a different criterion or decision. Requires an ADR in the Waiver cell. |

### Waiver cell

Write `-` when the row is `Met` or `Unmet`. Write `ADR-NNN` when the row is
`Waived` or `Superseded`, naming a decision record that exists in
`decision-record.md`. A waiver naming an ADR that is not there fails validation:
the point of a waiver is that someone recorded the reasoning, so an unbacked
waiver is treated as an unmet criterion rather than as a pass.

## 3. CLOSURE STATEMENT

**Closeable:** Yes

AC-001 carried the packet: the review reversed the identifier design on evidence before anyone approved it. Left out on purpose: the rewrite-window decisions, which phase 005 takes with the operator at that moment.
