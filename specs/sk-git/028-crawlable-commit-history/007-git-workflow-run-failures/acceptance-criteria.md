## 1. METADATA

**Packet:** sk-git/028-crawlable-commit-history/007-git-workflow-run-failures
**Level:** 3
**Status:** Complete
**Date:** 2026-09-11
<!-- /ANCHOR:metadata -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:criteria -->
## 2. CRITERIA

One row per criterion. `AC-ID` is stable once written: supersede a criterion, never renumber it.

| AC-ID | REQ | Given / When / Then | Verification | Status | Waiver |
|-------|-----|---------------------|--------------|--------|--------|
| AC-001 | REQ-001 | Given the observed list, When the lineage runs, Then every item is reproduced or shown impossible with the command | research/lineages/deepseek/research.md, five iterations; conductor re-ran the lock and trailer cases | Met | - |
| AC-002 | REQ-002 | Given each confirmed failure in scope, When adjusted, Then the producer changed and a harness case covers it | commits 53a7e2f008, 48f06d6bc8, c934677956; harnesses 2, 11, 25, 43, 25 node, 39, 24, 18, 7 | Met | - |
| AC-003 | REQ-003 | Given the adjusted tree, When a fresh fan-out lineage runs, Then it settles with succeeded 1 | research/proof/orchestration-summary.json succeeded 1, failed 0 | Met | - |

### Status values

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `Met` | Verified. The Verification cell names evidence that was actually observed. |
| `Unmet` | Not yet satisfied. Blocks closure. |
| `Waived` | Deliberately not pursued. Requires an ADR in the Waiver cell. |
| `Superseded` | Replaced by a different criterion or decision. Requires an ADR in the Waiver cell. |

### Waiver cell

Write `-` when the row is `Met` or `Unmet`. Write `ADR-NNN` when the row is
`Waived` or `Superseded`, naming a decision record that exists in
`decision-record.md`. A waiver naming an ADR that is not there fails validation:
the point of a waiver is that someone recorded the reasoning, so an unbacked
waiver is treated as an unmet criterion rather than as a pass.

## 3. CLOSURE STATEMENT

**Closeable:** Yes

AC-003 carried the packet with a lineage that settled clean on the adjusted tree. Left out on purpose: the four runtime seams, named with producer lines for a system-deep-loop packet, and the pi dispatch guard, named for the dispatch hooks' owner.
