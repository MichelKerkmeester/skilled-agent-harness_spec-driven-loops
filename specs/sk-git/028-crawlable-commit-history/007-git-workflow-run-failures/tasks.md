<!-- ANCHOR:phase-1 -->
## Phase 1: Setup

- [x] T001 Gather the observed list from this packet's own run (scratch/observed-failures.md)
- [x] T002 Write the five-angle analysis brief (research/dispatch-prompt.md)
- [x] T003 [P] Run the analysis lineage on a frozen tree and reduce it (research/research.md)
<!-- /ANCHOR:phase-1 -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:phase-2 -->
## Phase 2: Implementation

- [x] T004 Hooks: autostash anchor, bypass lines, trailer length, installer status (.opencode/scripts/git-hooks)
- [x] T005 sk-git scripts: advisory effective directory, allocator lock reclaim (.opencode/skills/sk-git/scripts)
- [x] T006 bin scripts: reaper safety, base persistence, sync rewrite log (.opencode/bin)
- [x] T007 Name the four runtime seams for their own packet (research/research.md)
<!-- /ANCHOR:phase-2 -->
