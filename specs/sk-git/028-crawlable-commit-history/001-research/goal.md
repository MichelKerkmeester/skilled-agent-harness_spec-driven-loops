<!-- ANCHOR:directive -->
## 1. DURABLE DIRECTIVE

**Objective:** Produce ten iterations of evidence-cited research on a numbered, searchable commit grammar for sk-git, on how a per-commit identifier is minted without collisions across branches, and on how 9,106 commits are rewritten and their citations remapped safely.

### Decisions

Frozen choices. Changing one is an amendment.

| ID | Decision |
|----|----------|
| D1 | Executor is cli-pi with deepseek-v4.1-flash at max thinking, 10 iterations, convergence off. |
| D2 | Every claim cites a local file and line. Nothing is fetched. |
| D3 | This phase produces findings only. No file outside research/ changes. |

### Operator copy

The operator holds this directive as the session objective, and that copy is
what judges completion, not this file. Whenever anything above the log changes
(objective, a decision, the binding table, a criterion), resend the full text
of this file in chat so the operator can update their copy. A child goal change
that alters a parent decision or criterion is an amendment to the parent: apply
it there first, then resend the parent.

## 3. COMPLETION CRITERIA

Three to seven bullets, each checkable without opening another file. Copy them
verbatim into the objective: nothing dereferences a path, so criteria left only
here are invisible to whatever judges completion.

- [ ] research/lineages/deepseek/deep-research-state.jsonl holds 10 iteration records
- [ ] research/lineages/deepseek/iterations/iteration-001.md through iteration-010.md exist
- [ ] research/research.md ranks recommendations and marks each implementable today or needs a decision
- [ ] One cited file:line opened by the orchestrator resolves to the quoted text

## 4. LOG

Everything below is VOLATILE. It is not part of the directive, it is not copied
into the objective, and it is expected to grow. Progress, evidence, deviations
and findings belong here.

### Progress

| Item | State | Evidence |
|------|-------|----------|
| Phase opened | Pending | |

### Deviations and findings

| Item | Note |
|------|------|
| None yet | |
