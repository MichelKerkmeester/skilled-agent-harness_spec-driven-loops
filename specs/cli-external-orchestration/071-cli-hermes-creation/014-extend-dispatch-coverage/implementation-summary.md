<!-- ANCHOR:what-built -->
## What Was Built

Added `.opencode/hooks/dispatch/cursor/dispatch-preflight-lint.mjs` and a pre-execution hook in `.opencode/plugins/cli-dispatch-audit.js`, both calling the shared engine in `.opencode/hooks/dispatch/lib/dispatch-rule-checks.mjs` rather than copying it. Widened three predicates there, added two Pi checks declared in the cli-pi packet, and registered the Cursor binding in the hook registry.
