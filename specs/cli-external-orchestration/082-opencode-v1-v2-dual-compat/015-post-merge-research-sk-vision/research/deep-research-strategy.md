# Deep Research Strategy - post-merge dual-compat research

## 2. TOPIC
What runtime bugs and drift remain in sk-vision's OpenCode 2 support after the 2026-10-19 merge to main: tool registration through ctx.tool.transform and the SK_VISION_AUTOINSPECT switch, the 2-second grace path, RuntimeClient.close(), the interpreter checks and the venv mkdir race

---

<!-- ANCHOR:key-questions -->
## 3. KEY QUESTIONS (remaining)
- [x] Which sk-vision OpenCode 2 runtime paths (registration, grace, close, interpreter checks, venv race) can still misbehave, and what fix does each need?

<!-- /ANCHOR:key-questions -->

---

## 4. NON-GOALS
- Changing code or docs; fixes land in later phases.
- Re-running the original 20-iteration run in `../../research/`.
- Mutating `~/.pi`, `trust.json`, global installs or the shared OpenCode 2 service (PID 46220).

---

## 5. STOP CONDITIONS
- All 10 steered iterations have run (stop policy max-iterations, convergence off).
- A credential or quota error from llmgateway stops the session at the next boundary.

## 11A. CARRIED-FORWARD OPEN QUESTIONS
- No open research question blocks this run (single-iteration config). The findings convert directly into implementation-sized follow-ups, each with its stated fix. (iteration 1)
- Carried from 013 and outside a read-only research run: no live run of the grace path (decision 6), no live rerun of the round-4 fixes (limitation 3). See obs-iter001-003. (iteration 1)

## 12. KNOWN CONTEXT
- The original 20-iteration run and its synthesis: `../../research/research.md` and `../../research/steering-log.md` (packet 082).
- Merged to main on 2026-10-19: 143 `fe1f8a9a53` (dual compat, sk-vision phases 012-013), 146 `8e8e95e8e6` (Pi fast-mode copy claim), 147 `6358d81eba` (worktree provisioning, adapter suite runner as `hooks/024`).
- Merge-time faults: `session-relaunch.js` lacked `dualPlugin` (fixed in `fe1f8a9a53`, evidence `../011-two-version-proof-and-closeout/scratch/main-merge/`); duplicate `hooks/023` numbering (renumbered to 024); main's global-only fast-mode check left no `--fast` in the main checkout (`specs/system-deep-loop/040-cli-pi-worktree-extension-clash/scratch/main-merge/fast-flag-matrix.txt`).
- Open: a plain `pi --offline --help` in the trusted main checkout still lists no `--fast` with the copy claim, while `-a`, `-na` and worktrees list it once.
- resource-map.md not present; skipping coverage gate

## 13. RESEARCH BOUNDARIES
- Max iterations: 1
- Convergence threshold: 0 (convergence mode off, stop policy max-iterations)
- Per-iteration budget: 24 tool calls, 10 minutes (executor timeout 1800 s)
- Progressive synthesis: true (default)
- research/research.md ownership: workflow-owned canonical synthesis output
- Lifecycle branches: `resume`, `restart` (live); `fork`, `completed-continue` (deferred, not runtime-wired)
- Machine-owned sections: reducer controls Sections 3, 6, 7-11A, including Section 10A pivot lineage
- Question injection surface: `{spec_folder}/research/inbox.jsonl`
- Question conflict owner: reducer registry; `question_conflict` events surface inbox/registry disagreements for operator decision
- Canonical pause sentinel: `research/.deep-research-pause`
- Capability matrix: `.skilled/skills/system-deep-loop/deep-research/assets/runtime-capabilities.json`
- Capability matrix doc: `.skilled/skills/system-deep-loop/deep-research/references/guides/capability-matrix.md`
- Capability resolver: `.skilled/skills/system-deep-loop/deep-research/scripts/runtime-capabilities.cjs`
- Current generation: 2
