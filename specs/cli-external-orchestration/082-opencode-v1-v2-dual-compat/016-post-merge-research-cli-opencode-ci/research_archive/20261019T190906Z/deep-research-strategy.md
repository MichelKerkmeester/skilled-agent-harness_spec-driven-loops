# Deep Research Strategy - post-merge dual-compat research

## 2. TOPIC
Where do cli-opencode's docs, flags and dispatch shapes, the doctor OpenCode version battery and the dual-version CI workflow drift from OpenCode 1.19.3 and 2.0.32 as installed after the 2026-10-19 merge to main, and did the CI workflow pass on main

<!-- ANCHOR:key-questions -->
## 3. KEY QUESTIONS (remaining)
Generated from the reducer registry. Add external or late questions through `{spec_folder}/research/inbox.jsonl`; direct edits are imported as compatibility input and may be replaced on the next reduce step.

- [ ] Which cli-opencode docs, flags and subcommands drift from OpenCode 1.19.3 and 2.0.32 as installed?
- [ ] Do the doctor battery and the dual-version CI workflow test what they claim, and did CI pass on main?
<!-- /ANCHOR:key-questions -->

---

## 4. NON-GOALS
- Changing code or docs; fixes land in later phases.
- Re-running the original 20-iteration run in `../../research/`.
- Mutating `~/.pi`, `trust.json`, global installs or the shared OpenCode 2 service (PID 46220).

---

## 5. STOP CONDITIONS
- All 10 steered iterations have run (stop policy max-iterations, convergence off).
- A credential or quota error from llmgateway stops the session at the next boundary.

<!-- ANCHOR:next-focus -->
## 11. NEXT FOCUS
A24 cli-opencode docs and flag drift: where do `.skilled/skills/cli-external-orchestration/cli-opencode/` (SKILL.md, references, assets) and its dispatch code disagree with OpenCode 1.19.3 (`opencode`) and 2.0.32 (`opencode2`) as installed on this machine? Compare every documented flag, subcommand and dispatch shape against `opencode --help`, `opencode run --help`, `opencode2 --help` and `opencode2 run --help`, and the version detection in the deep-loop runtime (`.skilled/skills/system-deep-loop/runtime/scripts/opencode-version.cjs`). Output: a drift table (doc claim, installed reality, file:line, severity) labelled confirmed or documented. Check: run the help commands only; never start, stop or restart any OpenCode service or server (PID 46220 is shared), never run `opencode upgrade`, and never edit files outside this research packet.

## 12. KNOWN CONTEXT
- The original 20-iteration run and its synthesis: `../../research/research.md` and `../../research/steering-log.md` (packet 082).
- Merged to main on 2026-10-19: 143 `fe1f8a9a53` (dual compat, sk-vision phases 012-013), 146 `8e8e95e8e6` (Pi fast-mode copy claim), 147 `6358d81eba` (worktree provisioning, adapter suite runner as `hooks/024`).
- Merge-time faults: `session-relaunch.js` lacked `dualPlugin` (fixed in `fe1f8a9a53`, evidence `../011-two-version-proof-and-closeout/scratch/main-merge/`); duplicate `hooks/023` numbering (renumbered to 024); main's global-only fast-mode check left no `--fast` in the main checkout (`specs/system-deep-loop/040-cli-pi-worktree-extension-clash/scratch/main-merge/fast-flag-matrix.txt`).
- Open: a plain `pi --offline --help` in the trusted main checkout still lists no `--fast` with the copy claim, while `-a`, `-na` and worktrees list it once.
- resource-map.md not present; skipping coverage gate

## 13. RESEARCH BOUNDARIES
- Max iterations: 2
- Convergence threshold: 0 (convergence mode off, stop policy max-iterations)
- Per-iteration budget: 24 tool calls, 10 minutes (executor timeout 1800 s)
- Progressive synthesis: true (default)
- research/research.md ownership: workflow-owned canonical synthesis output
- Lifecycle branches: `resume`, `restart` (live); `fork`, `completed-continue` (deferred, not runtime-wired)
- Machine-owned sections: reducer controls Sections 3, 6, 7-11A, including Section 10A pivot lineage
- Question injection surface: `{spec_folder}/research/inbox.jsonl`
- Question conflict owner: reducer registry; `question_conflict` events surface inbox/registry disagreements for operator decision
- Canonical pause sentinel: `research/.deep-research-pause`
- Capability matrix: `.skilled/skills/system-deep-loop/deep-research/assets/runtime-capabilities.json`
- Capability matrix doc: `.skilled/skills/system-deep-loop/deep-research/references/guides/capability-matrix.md`
- Capability resolver: `.skilled/skills/system-deep-loop/deep-research/scripts/runtime-capabilities.cjs`
- Current generation: 1
- Started: 2026-10-19T18:32:04.735Z
