## 11. NEXT FOCUS
1. Fix F001, then re-run the retired-id sweep with a predicate that includes playbooks and non-changelog documentation, and correct AC-001/F002 evidence from the real run. 2. Correct the handover's verification statements (F003, F004, F005) before any session resumes from that file, since all three are read as fact by the next reader. 3. Resolve F006 by stating the real `defaultProvider`, and run the deferred `pi` default-resolution check to decide whether the `llmgateway` + `z-ai/glm-5.3-flash` pair resolves or silently falls through. 4. Delete the duplicated paragraph (F007) while editing the closure section for F002. Review verdict: CONDITIONAL

## 12. ACTIVE RISKS
- 1 active P1 finding(s) — required before release; not a P0 but still blocks PASS.
