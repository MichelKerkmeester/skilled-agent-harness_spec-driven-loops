## Task Notation

| Prefix | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `[ ]` | Pending |
| `[x]` | Completed |
| `[P]` | Parallelizable |
| `[B]` | Blocked |

**Task Format**: `T### [P?] Description (file path)`
<!-- /ANCHOR:notation -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:phase-1 -->
## Phase 1: Setup

- [ ] T001 Probe the untrusted mutation refusal and record the exact message and exit status (`scratch/trusted-refusal.log`)
- [ ] T002 Re-measure the `explicit.ts` line ranges and map examples the scoring reference cites (`scratch/reference-check.md`)
- [ ] T003 Inventory every reader of routing phrases across the runtime and the skill-authoring scripts (`scratch/phrase-readers.md`)
- [ ] T004 [P] Record the doctor's declared phrase range and the current map extremes (`scratch/bound.md`)
<!-- /ANCHOR:phase-1 -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:phase-2 -->
## Phase 2: Implementation

- [ ] T005 State the `--trusted` requirement and the exit-64 refusal on the rebuild page (`feature-catalog/cli-surface/advisor-rebuild.md`)
- [ ] T006 State the same requirement on the scan page (`feature-catalog/cli-surface/skill-graph-scan.md`)
- [ ] T007 Correct every moved citation and stale example in the scorer reference from the re-measurement (`references/scoring/advisor-scorer.md`)
- [ ] T008 Declare the phrase-boost bound beside the map, aligned with the doctor's range (`runtime/lib/scorer/lanes/explicit.ts`)
- [ ] T009 Add the bound check to the scorer suite so an out-of-range value fails (`runtime/tests/`)
- [ ] T010 Record the routing-phrase source decision and apply it to the readers or the skills (`SKILL.md` plus the decided readers)
- [ ] T011 Add the optional embeddings health object to the status schema (`runtime/schemas/advisor-tool-schemas.ts`)
- [ ] T012 Build the health facts in the handler with a bounded read-only probe and an unavailable fallback (`runtime/handlers/advisor-status.ts`)
- [ ] T013 Declare the health option in the CLI manifest and make the existing semantic option requestable (`runtime/skill-advisor-cli-manifest.ts`)
- [ ] T014 Document the health surface, its read cost and its fail-soft contract (`feature-catalog/cli-surface/advisor-status.md`, `SKILL.md`)
<!-- /ANCHOR:phase-2 -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:phase-3 -->
## Phase 3: Verification

- [ ] T015 Add unit tests for the health present and unavailable states plus manifest acceptance (`runtime/tests/handlers/advisor-status.vitest.ts`, `runtime/tests/cli-exit-taxonomy.vitest.ts`)
- [ ] T016 Rebuild the runtime and run the live health call with the server up and down; record both (`scratch/verification.md`)
- [ ] T017 Rerun the citation, trusted-page and phrase-reader checks and record the output (`scratch/verification.md`)
- [ ] T018 Sync `acceptance-criteria.md` with the observed evidence for each row (`acceptance-criteria.md`)
