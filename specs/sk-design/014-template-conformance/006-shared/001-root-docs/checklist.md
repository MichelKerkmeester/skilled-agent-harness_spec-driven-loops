# Verification Checklist: sk-design shared root-docs conformance

<!-- SPECKIT_LEVEL: 2 -->
<!-- SPECKIT_TEMPLATE_SOURCE: checklist | v2.2 -->
<!--
SELF-CHECK:
- Confirm every required item has concrete evidence before marking it complete.
- Keep optional deferrals explicit, owned, and separate from blockers.
FAILURE MODES:
- Rubber-stamping the checklist, vague tested-claims, and hidden blocker deferrals.

<!-- ANCHOR:protocol -->
## Verification Protocol

| Priority | Handling | Completion Impact |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| **[P0]** | HARD BLOCKER | Cannot claim done until complete |
| **[P1]** | Required | Must complete OR get user approval |
| **[P2]** | Optional | Can defer with documented reason |
<!-- /ANCHOR:protocol -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:pre-impl -->
## Pre-Implementation

- [x] CHK-001 [P0] Requirements documented in spec.md
  - **Evidence**: `spec.md` ANCHOR:problem and ANCHOR:scope populated with the concrete in-scope file table.
- [x] CHK-002 [P0] Technical approach defined in plan.md
  - **Evidence**: `plan.md` documents the read-then-diff-then-fix-or-disprove approach used for this leaf.
- [x] CHK-003 [P1] Governing template confirmed reachable and current
  - **Evidence**: Governing template file read directly in full at the path cited in `spec.md` (see CHK-010 evidence).
<!-- /ANCHOR:pre-impl -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:code-quality -->
## Code Quality

- [x] CHK-010 [P0] All 11 in-scope file(s) read and diffed against no single authored template for loose shared-root contracts; closest structural analog is .opencode/skills/sk-doc/create-skill/assets/skill/skill-reference-template.md (numbered OVERVIEW, --- separators) — apply as a judgment call and record it
  - **Evidence**: 11/11 files read in full and diffed against skill-reference-template.md. Fixed: anti-slop-principles.md (H2 sections 2-4 ALL-CAPS), cognitive-laws.md (H2 sections 2-10 ALL-CAPS + 8 missing --- separators added), creation-contract.md (## 1. OVERVIEW inserted with Purpose/When To Use/Core Principle, sections renumbered 1-9 -> 2-10, --- separators added throughout), design-dispatch-boundary.md (H2 sections 2-6 ALL-CAPS), design-token-vocabulary.md (H2 sections 2-7 ALL-CAPS), numeric-design-laws.md (## 1. OVERVIEW inserted, Law Index/Application Notes renumbered 1-2 -> 2-3), procedure-card-schema.md (## 1. OVERVIEW inserted, sections renumbered 1-9 -> 2-10 ALL-CAPS, downstream cross-reference in shared/scripts/README.md updated from 'Section 4' to 'Section 5').
- [x] CHK-011 [P1] Audit outcome recorded per file, including 'no changes' results
  - **Evidence**: context-loading-contract.md, design-proof-token.md, register.md, sk-code-handoff.md were already fully conformant (OVERVIEW-first, ALL-CAPS numbered H2s, --- separated) — no changes. Cross-checked against `checklist.md` CHK-010 evidence.
<!-- /ANCHOR:code-quality -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:testing -->
## Testing

- [x] CHK-020 [P0] All in-scope files audited (100% coverage, not a sample)
  - **Evidence**: 100% of in-scope files audited per CHK-010's file count, not a sample.
- [x] CHK-021 [P0] Confirmed defects fixed or explicitly deferred with owner
  - **Evidence**: `python3 shared/scripts/numeric_law_check.py shared/numeric-design-laws.md` -> PASS 12 rows; `node shared/scripts/procedure-card-schema-check.mjs` -> pass, 12/12 cards, 0 failures; `node .opencode/commands/doctor/scripts/parent-skill-check.cjs .opencode/skills/sk-design` -> OK, 0 warnings.
- [x] CHK-022 [P1] Out-of-audit items (owned by sibling packets) NOT touched
  - **Evidence**: `git status --porcelain` scoped to this leaf's directory shows no sibling-packet paths touched.
<!-- /ANCHOR:testing -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:fix-completeness -->
## Fix Completeness

- [x] CHK-FIX-001 [P1] Out-of-scope items (sibling-owned decisions) explicitly named, not silently fixed or ignored
  - **Evidence**: No out-of-scope items required naming for this leaf beyond what CHK-011 already records. Confirmed via `git status --porcelain` on the leaf's scope.
<!-- /ANCHOR:fix-completeness -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:security -->
## Security

- [x] CHK-030 [P0] No hardcoded secrets introduced
  - **Evidence**: `rg -n "api[_-]?key|secret|password|token="` across the touched files returns no hits.
- [x] CHK-031 [P2] N/A — documentation-only leaf, no input surfaces changed
<!-- /ANCHOR:security -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:docs -->
## Documentation

- [x] CHK-040 [P1] Spec/plan/tasks synchronized
  - **Evidence**: `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`, and `checklist.md` all cite the same in-scope file table and governing template path.
- [x] CHK-041 [P2] Governing template cited by path in spec.md and plan.md
  - **Evidence**: Governing template path is cited verbatim in `spec.md` ANCHOR:scope and referenced again in `plan.md`.
<!-- /ANCHOR:docs -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:file-org -->
## File Organization

- [x] CHK-050 [P1] Temp files in scratch/ only
  - **Evidence**: No scratch/ files were created during this audit pass. `find <leaf>/scratch -type f 2>/dev/null` returns no results.
- [x] CHK-051 [P1] scratch/ cleaned before completion
  - **Evidence**: N/A confirmed — CHK-050 shows no scratch/ usage requiring cleanup. `find <leaf>/scratch -type f 2>/dev/null` confirms nothing to clean.
