## 1. METADATA

**Packet:** specs/sk-design/018-sk-design-parent-v2/001-sk-create-chart/023-metric-delta-header
**Level:** 2
**Status:** Planned
**Date:** 2026-09-08
<!-- /ANCHOR:metadata -->

<!-- ANCHOR:criteria -->
## 2. CRITERIA

One row per criterion. `AC-ID` is stable once written: supersede a criterion, never renumber it.

| AC-ID | REQ | Given / When / Then | Verification | Status | Waiver |
|-------|-----|---------------------|--------------|--------|--------|
| AC-001 | REQ-001 | Given a time-series form with a baseline, When METRIC is present, Then the value, delta and period render above the plot and both numbers are table cells | pending | Unmet | - |
| AC-002 | REQ-001 | Given a form without a baseline, When METRIC is absent, Then the header is unchanged and the assertion accepts it | pending | Unmet | - |
| AC-003 | REQ-002 | Given the palette source, When the type-scale family runs, Then the metric rung is published and the header sizes pass | pending | Unmet | - |

### Status values

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `Met` | Verified. The Verification cell names evidence that was actually observed. |
| `Unmet` | Not yet satisfied. Blocks closure. |
| `Waived` | Deliberately not pursued. Requires an ADR in the Waiver cell. |
| `Superseded` | Replaced by a different criterion or decision. Requires an ADR in the Waiver cell. |

### Waiver cell

Write `-` when the row is `Met` or `Unmet`. Write `ADR-NNN` when the row is
`Waived` or `Superseded`, naming a decision record that exists in
`decision-record.md`. A waiver naming an ADR that is not there fails validation:
the point of a waiver is that someone recorded the reasoning, so an unbacked
waiver is treated as an unmet criterion rather than as a pass.

## 3. CLOSURE STATEMENT

**Closeable:** No

The build has not started; phase 022 lands first.
