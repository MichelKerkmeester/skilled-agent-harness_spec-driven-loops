## Task Notation

| Prefix | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `[ ]` | Pending |
| `[x]` | Completed |
| `[P]` | Parallelizable |
| `[B]` | Blocked |

**Task Format**: `T### [P?] Description (file path)`
<!-- /ANCHOR:notation -->

<!-- ANCHOR:phase-1 -->
## Phase 1: Setup

- [x] T001 Split every capture across fresh reviewers, briefed without my own expectations
<!-- /ANCHOR:phase-1 -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:phase-2 -->
## Phase 2: Implementation

- [x] T002 Verify each reported defect against the image and the source before acting
- [x] T003 Fix the twelve confirmed, from an inverted heatmap caption to an axis title over its ticks
- [x] T004 Take the operator's rule: the readings carry the hue, the ink becomes the emphasis
- [x] T005 Add the family for prose that names a lightness direction
- [x] T006 Stop capturing the contact sheet, and record why
- [x] T007 Changelog v2.1.0.0 and the version field
<!-- /ANCHOR:phase-2 -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:phase-3 -->
## Phase 3: Verification

- [x] T008 Re-render and read the repaired figures
- [x] T009 Corpus, suite and captures from the final state
<!-- /ANCHOR:phase-3 -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:completion -->
## Completion Criteria

- [x] All tasks marked `[x]`
- [x] No `[B]` blocked tasks remaining
- [x] Manual verification passed
<!-- /ANCHOR:completion -->

- [x] CHK-FIX-005 [P1] Matrix axes and row count are listed before completion is claimed.
- [x] CHK-FIX-006 [P1] Hostile env/global-state variant executed when tests or code read process-wide state.
- [x] CHK-FIX-007 [P1] Evidence is pinned to a fix SHA or explicit diff range, not a moving branch-relative range.
