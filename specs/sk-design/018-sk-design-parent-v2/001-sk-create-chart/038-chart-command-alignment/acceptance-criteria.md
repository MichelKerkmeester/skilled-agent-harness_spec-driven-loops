## 1. METADATA

**Packet:** 038-chart-command-alignment
**Level:** 2
**Status:** Complete
**Date:** 2026-09-10
<!-- /ANCHOR:metadata -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:criteria -->
## 2. CRITERIA

One row per criterion. `AC-ID` is stable once written: supersede a criterion, never renumber it.

| AC-ID | REQ | Given / When / Then | Verification | Status | Waiver |
|-------|-----|---------------------|--------------|--------|--------|
| AC-001 | REQ-001 | Given the four command files, When every `.opencode/` path they name is tested against the disk, Then none is missing | Sweep run before the fix reported `assets/examples/` missing; after the fix reports nothing | Met | - |
| AC-002 | REQ-002 | Given the router and YAMLs, When grepped for `create-chart` and `26 forms`, Then nothing matches | grep empty from the final state | Met | - |
| AC-003 | REQ-003 | Given both YAMLs, When their `skill_reference.skill` is read, Then it is `sk-design`, the hub whose `mode-registry.json` registers `sk-design-chart` | `mode-registry.json:145-164`; grep for `sk-doc` in the four files empty | Met | - |

### Status values

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `Met` | Verified. The Verification cell names evidence that was actually observed. |
| `Unmet` | Not yet satisfied. Blocks closure. |
| `Waived` | Deliberately not pursued. Requires an ADR in the Waiver cell. |
| `Superseded` | Replaced by a different criterion or decision. Requires an ADR in the Waiver cell. |

### Waiver cell

Write `-` when the row is `Met` or `Unmet`. Write `ADR-NNN` when the row is
`Waived` or `Superseded`, naming a decision record that exists in
`decision-record.md`. A waiver naming an ADR that is not there fails validation:
the point of a waiver is that someone recorded the reasoning, so an unbacked
waiver is treated as an unmet criterion rather than as a pass.

## 3. CLOSURE STATEMENT

**Closeable:** Yes

Five stale names in three files, all fixed; the gallery principle line was left because it is still true.
