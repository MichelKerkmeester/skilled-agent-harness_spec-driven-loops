# Implementation Plan: Phase 1: roster-completeness

<!-- SPECKIT_LEVEL: 2 -->

<!-- ANCHOR:summary -->
## 1. SUMMARY

### Technical Context

| Aspect | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Language/Stack** | TypeScript (ESM) plus a CommonJS runner script |
| **Framework** | None |
| **Storage** | Git working tree, JSONL state and status ledgers |
| **Testing** | Vitest |

### Overview
The router, the skill file, both protocols and the runtime catalog now name the kinds the executor config registers. Counts that a registry owns point at the registry instead of repeating a number.

## 2. QUALITY GATES

### Definition of Ready
- [x] Problem statement clear and scope documented
- [x] Success criteria measurable
- [x] Dependencies identified

### Definition of Done
- [x] All acceptance criteria met
- [x] Tests passing (if applicable)
- [x] Docs updated (spec/plan/tasks)
<!-- /ANCHOR:quality-gates -->

<!-- ANCHOR:architecture -->
## 3. ARCHITECTURE

### Pattern
Documentation sourced to its authority

### Key Components
- **ROUTER.md**: Parenthetical, leaf bullets, disambiguation rule
- **SKILL.md**: Mode count sourced to the registry
- **Loop protocols**: Adapter lists sourced to the executor config
- **Runtime catalog**: Kind list and count

### Data Flow
Executor config and mode registry are the authorities; prose names them rather than restating their contents.

## FIX ADDENDUM: AFFECTED SURFACES

| Surface | Current Role | Action | Verification |
|---------|--------------|--------|--------------|
| Router prose | Six of seven kinds | update | six cli-hermes mentions, was three |
| Skill file | One count contradicting four | update | no 'all six modes' remains |
| Protocols and catalog | Three kinds, one duplicated | update | every kind named, sourced to the config |

Required inventories:
- Same-class producers: five prose rosters across three hubs.
- Consumers: two compiled contracts, regenerated.
- Verified: the registry holds seven modes, the executor config eight kinds including native.

## 4. IMPLEMENTATION PHASES

Follow the ordered tasks in `tasks.md`. It owns the Setup, Implementation and Verification phase checkboxes and task state.

<!-- ANCHOR:testing -->
## 5. TESTING STRATEGY

| Test Type | Scope | Tools |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Drift | Regenerated contracts | Vitest |
| Grep | Roster presence per file | shell |
| Suite | Whole runtime | Vitest |

## 6. DEPENDENCIES

| Dependency | Type | Status | Impact if Blocked |
|------------|------|--------|-------------------|
| Compile script for contracts | Internal | Green | - |
<!-- /ANCHOR:dependencies -->

<!-- ANCHOR:rollback -->
## 7. ROLLBACK PLAN

- **Trigger**: A roster names a kind the code drops
- **Procedure**: Revert this phase's commit
<!-- /ANCHOR:rollback -->

## L2: EFFORT ESTIMATION

| Phase | Complexity | Estimated Effort |
|-------|------------|------------------|
| Setup | Low | minutes |
| Core Implementation | Low | one dispatch |
| Verification | Med | full suite run |
| **Total** | | **one dispatch plus one suite run** |

## L2: ENHANCED ROLLBACK

### Pre-deployment Checklist
- [ ] Backup created (if data changes)
- [ ] Feature flag configured
- [ ] Monitoring alerts set

### Rollback Procedure
1. [Immediate action - e.g., disable feature flag]
2. [Revert code - e.g., git revert or redeploy previous version]
3. [Verify rollback - e.g., smoke test critical paths]
4. [Notify stakeholders - if user-facing]

### Data Reversal
- **Has data migrations?** [Yes/No]
- **Reversal procedure**: [Steps or "N/A"]
