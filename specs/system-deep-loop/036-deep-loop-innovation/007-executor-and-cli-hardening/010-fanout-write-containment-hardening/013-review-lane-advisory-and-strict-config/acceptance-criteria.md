## 1. METADATA

**Packet:** system-deep-loop/036-deep-loop-innovation/007-executor-and-cli-hardening/010-fanout-write-containment-hardening/013-review-lane-advisory-and-strict-config
**Level:** 2
**Status:** Complete
**Date:** 2026-09-14
<!-- /ANCHOR:metadata -->

<!-- ANCHOR:criteria -->
## 2. CRITERIA

One row per criterion. `AC-ID` is stable once written: supersede a criterion, never renumber it.

| AC-ID | REQ | Given / When / Then | Verification | Status | Waiver |
|-------|-----|---------------------|--------------|--------|--------|
| AC-001 | REQ-001 | Given a review lane with open findings, When it settles, Then no empty-registry warning is raised; a research lane with deltas and no key findings still warns | `fanout-run.vitest.ts:4663` and `:4728`; the review fixture warned against the unmodified runner | Met | - |
| AC-002 | REQ-002 | Given a config with `containment.worktrees`, When parsed, Then it is rejected with a message naming the key, in both shapes | `executor-config.vitest.ts:526`; accepted silently before | Met | - |
| AC-003 | REQ-003 | Given the two retained review lineages, When the check is replayed, Then both return no warning | `045-fanout-write-containment-hardening/review/lineages/deepseek/deep-review-findings-registry.json:1` and `review/lineages/luna/deep-review-findings-registry.json:1` replayed through the exported check: `deepseek: null`, `luna: null` | Met | - |

### Status values

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `Met` | Verified. The Verification cell names evidence that was actually observed. |
| `Unmet` | Not yet satisfied. Blocks closure. |
| `Waived` | Deliberately not pursued. Requires an ADR in the Waiver cell. |
| `Superseded` | Replaced by a different criterion or decision. Requires an ADR in the Waiver cell. |

### Waiver cell

Write `-` when the row is `Met` or `Unmet`. Write `ADR-NNN` when the row is
`Waived` or `Superseded`, naming a decision record that exists in
`decision-record.md`. A waiver naming an ADR that is not there fails validation:
the point of a waiver is that someone recorded the reasoning, so an unbacked
waiver is treated as an unmet criterion rather than as a pass.

## 3. CLOSURE STATEMENT

**Closeable:** [Yes/No]

[One or two sentences: which criteria carried the packet, and what was consciously
left out. Write this when the packet is closed, not before.]
