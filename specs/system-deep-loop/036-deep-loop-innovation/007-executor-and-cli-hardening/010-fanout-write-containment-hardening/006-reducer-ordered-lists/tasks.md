# Tasks: Make the lineage reducer extract numbered findings and flag a fulfilled lane whose registry stays empty

<!-- SPECKIT_LEVEL: 2 -->

<!-- ANCHOR:notation -->
## Task Notation

| Prefix | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `[ ]` | Pending |
| `[x]` | Completed |
| `[P]` | Parallelizable |
| `[B]` | Blocked |

**Task Format**: `T### [P?] Description (file path)`
<!-- /ANCHOR:notation -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:phase-1 -->
## Phase 1: Setup

- [x] T001 Reproduce the missing registry on a temp copy of the SWE-2 lineage
- [x] T002 Run the anchor-less fixture against the unmodified reducer and record the throw
<!-- /ANCHOR:phase-1 -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:phase-2 -->
## Phase 2: Implementation

- [x] T003 Code the anchor throws and catch them in the reduce (`reduce-state.cjs`)
- [x] T004 Add the settle-time advisory (`fanout-run.cjs`)
- [x] T005 Add the two tests
<!-- /ANCHOR:phase-2 -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:phase-3 -->
## Phase 3: Verification

- [x] T006 Touched test files, cli reducer consumer and typecheck exit zero
- [x] T007 Reproduction writes 27 key findings with one strategy warning
- [x] T008 Full deep-loop suite exits zero
- [x] T009 Packet docs filled and strict validation passes
<!-- /ANCHOR:phase-3 -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:completion -->
## Completion Criteria

- [x] All tasks marked `[x]`
- [x] No `[B]` blocked tasks remaining
- [x] Manual verification passed
<!-- /ANCHOR:completion -->

<!-- ANCHOR:cross-refs -->
## Cross-References

- **Specification**: See `spec.md`
- **Plan**: See `plan.md`

## Verification Checklist

<!-- ANCHOR:protocol -->
## Verification Protocol

| Priority | Handling | Completion Impact |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| **[P0]** | HARD BLOCKER | Cannot claim done until complete |
| **[P1]** | Required | Must complete OR get user approval |
| **[P2]** | Optional | Can defer with documented reason |
<!-- /ANCHOR:protocol -->

<!-- ANCHOR:pre-impl -->
## Pre-Implementation

- [x] CHK-001 [P0] Requirements documented in spec.md
- [x] CHK-002 [P0] Technical approach defined in plan.md
- [x] CHK-003 [P1] Dependencies identified and available
<!-- /ANCHOR:pre-impl -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:code-quality -->
## Code Quality

- [x] CHK-010 [P0] Code passes lint/format checks (typecheck exit 0)
- [x] CHK-011 [P0] No console errors or warnings
- [x] CHK-012 [P1] Error handling implemented
- [x] CHK-013 [P1] Code follows project patterns
<!-- /ANCHOR:code-quality -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:testing -->
## Testing Checklist

- [x] CHK-020 [P0] All acceptance criteria met
- [x] CHK-021 [P0] Manual testing complete (not applicable; automated)
- [x] CHK-022 [P1] Edge cases tested (anchored strategy, no deltas, unreadable registry)
- [x] CHK-023 [P1] Error scenarios validated
<!-- /ANCHOR:testing -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:fix-completeness -->
## Fix Completeness

- [x] CHK-FIX-001 [P0] Finding class: `class-of-bug`
- [x] CHK-FIX-002 [P0] Same-class producer inventory: two anchor throws in the reducer, both coded
- [x] CHK-FIX-003 [P0] Consumer inventory: the reduce boundary and the cli reducer tests; the runner's fulfilled path
- [x] CHK-FIX-004 [P0] Not a path or parser fix; the strategy x deltas x registry matrix covers the rows
- [x] CHK-FIX-005 [P1] Matrix: strategy x deltas x registry, twelve rows
- [x] CHK-FIX-006 [P1] Not applicable: no process-wide state read
- [x] CHK-FIX-007 [P1] Evidence pinned to this phase's commit
<!-- /ANCHOR:fix-completeness -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:security -->
## Security

- [x] CHK-030 [P0] No hardcoded secrets
- [x] CHK-031 [P0] Input validation implemented (unchanged)
- [x] CHK-032 [P1] Not applicable
<!-- /ANCHOR:security -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:docs -->
## Documentation

- [x] CHK-040 [P1] Spec/plan/tasks synchronized
- [x] CHK-041 [P1] Code comments adequate
- [x] CHK-042 [P2] README not applicable
<!-- /ANCHOR:docs -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:file-org -->
## File Organization

- [x] CHK-050 [P1] Temp files in scratch/ only
- [x] CHK-051 [P1] scratch/ cleaned before completion
<!-- /ANCHOR:file-org -->
