"""Retries with exponential backoff and jitter, and the rule for what to retry.

A model call fails in two very different ways, and treating them alike is how
a gateway either drops work that would have succeeded or burns three times the
quota proving that a 400 is still a 400:

- **transient** — the request never got a verdict (timeout, connection reset)
  or the provider declined to give one *yet* (429, 5xx). Re-issuing the
  identical request can succeed.
- **deterministic** — the provider gave a verdict and it will not change (401,
  403, 400, 402, a content refusal). Re-issuing wastes time and money.

`is_transient` is the whole policy, and it is conservative: an exception has to
present evidence of transience to be retried. Anything unrecognized is treated
as deterministic and raised on the first attempt.

**Backoff.** Delay before attempt *n+1* is `initial * multiplier**(n-1)`,
capped at `max_backoff_seconds`, then multiplied by a random factor in
`[1 - jitter, 1]`. Shrinking rather than centring the jitter keeps successive
delays strictly increasing — the growth is a property of every draw, not of
the average — as long as `jitter < 1 - 1/multiplier`, which the defaults
satisfy. Above that the windows overlap and only the trend survives.

A `Retry-After` header, when the provider sends one, raises that delay (never
lowers it) but is itself capped by `max_backoff_seconds`: a provider asking for
a five-minute pause gets a bounded wait and then a raised error, rather than a
silently parked process.

Not covered, and worth being explicit about: streaming. Once a chunk has been
handed to the caller the request cannot be re-issued transparently, so
`_stream` is not retried by either backend.
