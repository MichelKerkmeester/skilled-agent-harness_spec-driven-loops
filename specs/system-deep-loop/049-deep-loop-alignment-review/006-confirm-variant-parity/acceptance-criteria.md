# Acceptance Criteria: Phase 5: confirm-variant-parity

<!-- HVR_REFERENCE: .opencode/skills/sk-doc/sk-create-with-human-voice/references/hvr-rules.md -->

> This document decides whether the packet may close. A packet is closeable when
> every row below is `Met`, `Waived` or `Superseded`. A `Waived` or `Superseded`
> row MUST name an ADR that exists in `decision-record.md`.

## 1. METADATA

**Packet:** system-deep-loop/049-deep-loop-alignment-review/006-confirm-variant-parity
**Level:** 2
**Status:** Complete
**Date:** 2026-09-15
<!-- /ANCHOR:metadata -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:criteria -->
## 2. CRITERIA

One row per criterion. `AC-ID` is stable once written: supersede a criterion, never renumber it.

| AC-ID | REQ | Given / When / Then | Verification | Status | Waiver |
|-------|-----|---------------------|--------------|--------|--------|
| AC-001 | REQ-001 | Given the seven measured divergences, When each confirm variant is read, Then the divergence is closed or a reason stands at that point | config record, gateway writes, resource map, staging, mechanical gate and session id all present; census carries the rest | Met | - |
| AC-002 | REQ-002 | Given every auto step, When matched against its confirm twin, Then it is present or censused | auto-only steps without a census entry: zero for review, zero for research | Met | - |
| AC-003 | REQ-003 | Given a divergence where the auto variant was wrong, When it is closed, Then the auto variant is corrected | three auto-side corrections: lineage fields read against a flat config, artifacts left unstaged, session-id token unbound | Met | - |
| AC-004 | REQ-004 | Given a future edit that adds an auto step without a confirm step or census entry, When the suite runs, Then it fails | four parity tests in the render-command-contract suite | Met | - |

### Status values

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `Met` | Verified. The Verification cell names evidence that was actually observed. |
| `Unmet` | Not yet satisfied. Blocks closure. |
| `Waived` | Deliberately not pursued. Requires an ADR in the Waiver cell. |
| `Superseded` | Replaced by a different criterion or decision. Requires an ADR in the Waiver cell. |

### Waiver cell

Write `-` when the row is `Met` or `Unmet`. Write `ADR-NNN` when the row is
`Waived` or `Superseded`, naming a decision record that exists in
`decision-record.md`. A waiver naming an ADR that is not there fails validation:
the point of a waiver is that someone recorded the reasoning, so an unbacked
waiver is treated as an unmet criterion rather than as a pass.

## 3. CLOSURE STATEMENT

**Closeable:** [Yes/No]

[One or two sentences: which criteria carried the packet, and what was consciously
left out. Write this when the packet is closed, not before.]
