# Deep-Review Iteration Prompt Pack (13 of 20)

## STATE

Iteration: 13 of 20
Dimension: maintainability — deep-review packet
Prior Findings: read `review/deep-review-findings-registry.json` for the current cumulative count before starting — do not assume 0.
Review Target: .opencode/skills/system-deep-loop/deep-review/

## READ FIRST

Read `review/deep-review-strategy.md` section 12 (Next Focus) and the LATEST iteration record(s) in `review/deep-review-state.jsonl` before starting — do not re-discover an already-registered finding as new; you may reference/reconfirm it if directly relevant, but only NEW findings belong in this iteration's `findingsNew`.

## THIS ITERATION'S FOCUS (deep-review packet, maintainability)

This is the LAST deep-review-packet iteration (iterations 10-13 done after this). Recap in the strategy file whether this packet is clean or carries findings forward.

1. **Clarity of the convergence/gate logic**: `references/convergence/convergence.md` and the state-check gate logic are genuinely complex (many named gates: convergenceGate, dimensionCoverageGate, p0ResolutionGate, claimAdjudicationGate, etc.) — is this documented in a way a future maintainer could actually follow, or does it require reading the workflow YAML source to understand?
2. **Post-trim organization**: after this session's SKILL.md trim, is `references/` still well-organized (not a dumping ground of disconnected files)?
3. **Duplication**: any content duplicated between SKILL.md and references/ that should live in only one place?

## SHARED DOCTRINE

Load `.opencode/skills/sk-code/code-review/references/review_core.md` before final severity calls.

## CLAIM ADJUDICATION

Every new P0/P1 must include: claim, evidenceRefs, counterevidenceSought, alternativeExplanation, finalSeverity, confidence, downgradeTrigger.

## CONSTRAINTS

- LEAF agent, no sub-dispatch. Target 9 tool calls, hard max 13.
- Review target is READ-ONLY. Do not modify reviewed files. Report findings only, do not implement fixes.
- **ALLOWED WRITE PATHS**: `review/iterations/iteration-013.md`, `review/deep-review-state.jsonl` (append-only), `review/deltas/iter-013.jsonl`, `review/deep-review-strategy.md` (in-place), `review/deep-review-findings-registry.json` (in-place). All under `.opencode/specs/system-deep-loop/052-deep-loop-unification/007-comprehensive-deep-review/`.
- **BANNED**: rm, rm -rf, git rm, mv, sed -i, rmdir, find -delete, any write outside the allowed-write list.
- **SCOPE VIOLATION PROTOCOL**: if out of scope, STOP and emit a `## SCOPE VIOLATIONS` finding instead.
- Do not re-count an already-registered finding in this iteration's own findingsSummary.

## OUTPUT CONTRACT

Three required artifacts:
1. `review/iterations/iteration-013.md` — Dimension, Files Reviewed, Findings by Severity, Traceability Checks, Verdict, Next Dimension.
2. Append to `review/deep-review-state.jsonl`, single-line JSON, `"type":"iteration"` exactly:
```json
{"type":"iteration","iteration":13,"mode":"review","target_agent":"deep-review","agent_definition_loaded":true,"resolved_route":"Resolved route: mode=review target_agent=deep-review","run":"run-013","status":"complete","focus":"maintainability-deep-review","dimensions":["maintainability"],"filesReviewed":["path:line"],"findingsCount":<n>,"findingsSummary":{"P0":<n>,"P1":<n>,"P2":<n>},"findingsNew":[],"traceabilityChecks":{},"newFindingsRatio":<0..1>,"sessionId":"2026-07-08T18:59:04.000Z","generation":1,"lineageMode":"new","timestamp":"<ISO-8601>","durationMs":<n>,"graphEvents":[]}
```
3. `review/deltas/iter-013.jsonl` — the iteration record plus one line per finding.
