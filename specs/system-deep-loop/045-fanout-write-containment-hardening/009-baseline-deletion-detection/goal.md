## 1. DURABLE DIRECTIVE

**Objective:** Report a lane that deletes a file which was untracked at baseline, so the no-deletion guarantee has no blind spot.

### Decisions

Frozen choices. Changing one is an amendment.

| ID | Decision |
|----|----------|
| D1 | The post-dispatch detection compares the baseline's untracked path set against the current tree: a baseline untracked path that no longer exists is reported as a deletion violation with the baseline hash, and under restore with captured content it is put back from the baseline copy. |
| D2 | A path deleted before dispatch stays subtracted, as today; only paths present at baseline and gone afterwards are new. |
| D3 | Fixed by DeepSeek V4.1 Flash at max through the gateway on cli-pi, one dispatch for this phase alone, verified by the deep-loop suite before the next phase starts. |

### Operator copy

The operator holds this directive as the session objective, and that copy is
what judges completion, not this file. Whenever anything above the log changes
(objective, a decision, the binding table, a criterion), resend the durable
slice of this file in chat, frontmatter excluded, so the operator can update
their copy. Keep reminding while it stays unset; never stop work for it. A
child goal change that alters a parent decision or criterion is an amendment
to the parent: apply it there first, then resend the parent.

## 3. COMPLETION CRITERIA

Three to seven bullets, each checkable without opening another file. Copy them
verbatim into the objective: nothing dereferences a path, so criteria left only
here are invisible to whatever judges completion.

- [ ] A stub lane that deletes a neighbour's untracked file present at baseline is reported with the path and baseline hash, and under restore with captured content the file comes back byte-identical
- [ ] The same test against the unmodified detector reports nothing
- [ ] The deep-loop runtime suite exits zero

## 4. LOG

Everything below is VOLATILE. It is not part of the directive, it is not copied
into the objective, and it is expected to grow. Progress, evidence, deviations
and findings belong here.

### Progress

| Item | State | Evidence |
|------|-------|----------|
| [Item] | [Pending/In Progress/Done] | [Command output, file:line, or artifact] |

### Deviations and findings

| Item | Note |
|------|------|
| [What diverged from the directive] | [Why, and what was done instead] |
