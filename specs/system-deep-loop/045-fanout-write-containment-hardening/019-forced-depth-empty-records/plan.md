# Implementation Plan: Phase 4: forced-depth-empty-records

<!-- SPECKIT_LEVEL: 2 -->

<!-- ANCHOR:summary -->
## 1. SUMMARY

### Technical Context

| Aspect | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Language/Stack** | TypeScript (ESM) plus a CommonJS runner script |
| **Framework** | None |
| **Storage** | Git working tree, JSONL state and status ledgers |
| **Testing** | Vitest |

### Overview
The validator counts unnumbered iteration records and fails when the usable set is empty with a positive cap, at both its call sites. The appender validates the iteration field before writing.

## 2. QUALITY GATES

### Definition of Ready
- [x] Problem statement clear and scope documented
- [x] Success criteria measurable
- [x] Dependencies identified

### Definition of Done
- [x] All acceptance criteria met
- [x] Tests passing (if applicable)
- [x] Docs updated (spec/plan/tasks)
<!-- /ANCHOR:quality-gates -->

<!-- ANCHOR:architecture -->
## 3. ARCHITECTURE

### Pattern
Fail closed on absence; refuse at the boundary

### Key Components
- **forcedDepthIterationViolation**: Empty usable set is a violation
- **append-state-record.cjs**: Iteration number required

### Data Flow
Leaf record → appender check → state log → settle-time collapse → set check including emptiness.

## FIX ADDENDUM: AFFECTED SURFACES

| Surface | Current Role | Action | Verification |
|---------|--------------|--------|--------------|
| Validator | Passed an empty set | update | fanout-run.vitest.ts:623, :637 |
| Appender | Accepted unnumbered records | update | trustworthy-state-records.vitest.ts:127 |
| Numbered records | Appended | unchanged | trustworthy-state-records.vitest.ts:155 |

Required inventories:
- Same-class producers: two validator call sites, one appender.
- Consumers: the research YAML directive that emits `run`, bound to the follow-on phase.
- Matrix axes: record numbering (iteration, run, none) x cap (positive, zero) x record type.

Follow the ordered tasks in `tasks.md`. It owns the Setup, Implementation and Verification phase checkboxes and task state.

<!-- ANCHOR:testing -->
## 5. TESTING STRATEGY

| Test Type | Scope | Tools |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Unit | Validator at both call sites; appender refusal and pass-through | Vitest |
| Suite | Whole runtime plus integration and lifecycle | Vitest |
| Manual | None | - |

## 6. DEPENDENCIES

| Dependency | Type | Status | Impact if Blocked |
|------------|------|--------|-------------------|
| None | - | Green | - |
<!-- /ANCHOR:dependencies -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:rollback -->
## 7. ROLLBACK PLAN

- **Trigger**: A legitimate record shape is refused
- **Procedure**: Revert this phase's commit
<!-- /ANCHOR:rollback -->

## L2: ENHANCED ROLLBACK

### Pre-deployment Checklist
- [ ] Backup created (if data changes)
- [ ] Feature flag configured
- [ ] Monitoring alerts set

### Rollback Procedure
1. [Immediate action - e.g., disable feature flag]
2. [Revert code - e.g., git revert or redeploy previous version]
3. [Verify rollback - e.g., smoke test critical paths]
4. [Notify stakeholders - if user-facing]

### Data Reversal
- **Has data migrations?** [Yes/No]
- **Reversal procedure**: [Steps or "N/A"]
