<!-- ANCHOR:notation -->
## Task Notation

| Prefix | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `[ ]` | Pending |
| `[x]` | Completed |
| `[P]` | Parallelizable |
| `[B]` | Blocked |

**Task Format**: `T### [P?] Description (file path)`
<!-- /ANCHOR:notation -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:phase-1 -->
## Phase 1: Setup

- [x] T001 Write the six dimensions and surfaces into this spec
- [x] T002 Persist the review config and launch three cli-devin lanes
<!-- /ANCHOR:phase-1 -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:phase-2 -->
## Phase 2: Implementation

- [x] T003 Merge the lanes and read every report
- [x] T004 Verify each P0 and P1 against the tree
- [x] T005 Bind confirmed findings to phases 016 to 020; record the rest
<!-- /ANCHOR:phase-2 -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:phase-3 -->
## Phase 3: Verification

- [x] T006 Phases 016 to 020 land with green suites
- [x] T007 This phase's criteria checked and the parent's last criterion closed
<!-- /ANCHOR:phase-3 -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:completion -->
## Completion Criteria

- [x] All tasks marked `[x]`
- [x] No `[B]` blocked tasks remaining
- [x] Manual verification passed
<!-- /ANCHOR:completion -->
