<!-- ANCHOR:notation -->
## Task Notation

| Prefix | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `[ ]` | Pending |
| `[x]` | Completed |
| `[P]` | Parallelizable |
| `[B]` | Blocked |

**Task Format**: `T### [P?] Description (file path)`
<!-- /ANCHOR:notation -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:phase-1 -->
## Phase 1: Setup

- [x] T001 Inventory every worktree surface: modules, tests, runner, config, docs, wrapper
- [x] T002 Decide the wrapper stays and amend D1
<!-- /ANCHOR:phase-1 -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:phase-2 -->
## Phase 2: Implementation

- [x] T003 Delete the five modules and five tests
- [x] T004 Remove the runner wiring, flag, events and summary; collapse lineage paths
- [x] T005 Remove the config field and the worktree test cases
- [x] T006 Update the catalog and playbooks; delete the isolated-run page
- [x] T007 Make the cumulative churn case deterministic
<!-- /ANCHOR:phase-2 -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:phase-3 -->
## Phase 3: Verification

- [x] T008 Typecheck and the full suite exit zero
- [x] T009 Launch-wrapper tests exit zero
- [x] T010 Live two-lane run with a neighbour writer settles fulfilled
- [x] T011 Packet docs filled and strict validation passes
<!-- /ANCHOR:phase-3 -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:completion -->
## Completion Criteria

- [x] All tasks marked `[x]`
- [x] No `[B]` blocked tasks remaining
- [x] Manual verification passed
<!-- /ANCHOR:completion -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:cross-refs -->
## Cross-References

- **Specification**: See `spec.md`
- **Plan**: See `plan.md`

## Verification Checklist

<!-- ANCHOR:protocol -->
## Verification Protocol

| Priority | Handling | Completion Impact |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| **[P0]** | HARD BLOCKER | Cannot claim done until complete |
| **[P1]** | Required | Must complete OR get user approval |
| **[P2]** | Optional | Can defer with documented reason |
<!-- /ANCHOR:protocol -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:pre-impl -->
## Pre-Implementation

- [x] CHK-001 [P0] Requirements documented in spec.md
- [x] CHK-002 [P0] Technical approach defined in plan.md
- [x] CHK-003 [P1] Dependencies identified and available
<!-- /ANCHOR:pre-impl -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:code-quality -->
## Code Quality

- [x] CHK-010 [P0] Code passes lint/format checks (typecheck exit 0)
- [x] CHK-011 [P0] No console errors or warnings
- [x] CHK-012 [P1] Error handling implemented
- [x] CHK-013 [P1] Code follows project patterns
<!-- /ANCHOR:code-quality -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:testing -->
## Testing Checklist

- [x] CHK-020 [P0] All acceptance criteria met
- [x] CHK-021 [P0] Manual testing complete (not applicable; automated)
- [x] CHK-022 [P1] Edge cases tested (two lanes on one checkout, neighbour untracked file)
- [x] CHK-023 [P1] Error scenarios validated
<!-- /ANCHOR:testing -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:fix-completeness -->
## Fix Completeness

- [x] CHK-FIX-001 [P0] Finding class: `cross-consumer`
- [x] CHK-FIX-002 [P0] Same-class producer inventory: one runner, one config schema, two docs surfaces
- [x] CHK-FIX-003 [P0] Consumer inventory: catalog, playbook index, two playbook pages, lib README, pool comment
- [x] CHK-FIX-004 [P0] Not a path or parser fix; the live run covers the concurrent-writer row
- [x] CHK-FIX-005 [P1] Matrix: surface x reference kind, eight rows
- [x] CHK-FIX-006 [P1] Not applicable
- [x] CHK-FIX-007 [P1] Evidence pinned to this phase's commit
<!-- /ANCHOR:fix-completeness -->

<!-- ANCHOR:security -->
## Security

- [x] CHK-030 [P0] No hardcoded secrets
- [x] CHK-031 [P0] Input validation implemented (unchanged)
- [x] CHK-032 [P1] Not applicable
<!-- /ANCHOR:security -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:docs -->
## Documentation

- [x] CHK-040 [P1] Spec/plan/tasks synchronized
- [x] CHK-041 [P1] Code comments adequate
- [x] CHK-042 [P2] README not applicable
<!-- /ANCHOR:docs -->

<!-- ANCHOR:file-org -->
## File Organization

- [x] CHK-050 [P1] Temp files in scratch/ only
- [x] CHK-051 [P1] scratch/ cleaned before completion
<!-- /ANCHOR:file-org -->
