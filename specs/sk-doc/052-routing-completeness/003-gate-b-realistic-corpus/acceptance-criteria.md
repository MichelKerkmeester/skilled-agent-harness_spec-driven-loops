# Acceptance Criteria: Phase 3: gate-b-realistic-corpus

<!-- HVR_REFERENCE: .opencode/skills/sk-doc/sk-create-with-human-voice/references/hvr-rules.md -->

> This document decides whether the packet may close. A packet is closeable when
> every row below is `Met`, `Waived` or `Superseded`. A `Waived` or `Superseded`
> row MUST name an ADR that exists in `decision-record.md`.

## 1. METADATA

**Packet:** [PACKET-ID]
**Level:** [2/3/3+]
**Status:** [Draft/In Progress/Complete]
**Date:** 2026-09-02
<!-- /ANCHOR:metadata -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:criteria -->
## 2. CRITERIA

One row per criterion. `AC-ID` is stable once written: supersede a criterion, never renumber it.

| AC-ID | REQ | Given / When / Then | Verification | Status | Waiver |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| AC-001 | REQ-001 | Given at least three realistic phrasings per mode, When the corpus is committed, Then no row contains its own mode name | `assets/realistic-corpus.tsv` holds 180 rows and a scan for the intended mode inside its own prompt returns zero | Met | |
| AC-002 | REQ-002 | Given the corpus, When it is measured through the daemon, Then the rate is recorded and reproducible | A second run of the same corpus returns 8 of 180 as top pick, matching `research/gate-b-measurement.md` | Met | |
| AC-003 | REQ-003 | Given the semantic lane, When its weight and embedding count are read, Then the structural cause is on record | `advisor_status` reports semantic_shadow at 0.05, and `select count(*) from skill_nodes where embedding is not null` returns 0 | Met | |
| AC-004 | REQ-004 | Given command-surface modes, When the denominator is fixed, Then they are excluded with the reason stated | The measurement document names both modes and their routingClass, and reports 8 of 172 alongside 8 of 180 | Met | |

### Status values

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `Met` | Verified. The Verification cell names evidence that was actually observed. |
| `Unmet` | Not yet satisfied. Blocks closure. |
| `Waived` | Deliberately not pursued. Requires an ADR in the Waiver cell. |
| `Superseded` | Replaced by a different criterion or decision. Requires an ADR in the Waiver cell. |

### Waiver cell

Write `-` when the row is `Met` or `Unmet`. Write `ADR-NNN` when the row is
`Waived` or `Superseded`, naming a decision record that exists in
`decision-record.md`. A waiver naming an ADR that is not there fails validation:
the point of a waiver is that someone recorded the reasoning, so an unbacked
waiver is treated as an unmet criterion rather than as a pass.

## 3. CLOSURE STATEMENT

**Closeable:** [Yes/No]

[One or two sentences: which criteria carried the packet, and what was consciously
left out. Write this when the packet is closed, not before.]
