**Deliverables**:
- [To be defined during planning]

<!-- ANCHOR:problem -->
## 2. PROBLEM & PURPOSE
<!-- FILL: State the problem in two sentences: what breaks, and for whom. GOOD: The rotate-logs script never deletes old archives, so a host that copies `logs/archive` fills its disk. WEAK: The script has issues with output. -->

### Problem Statement
[YOUR_VALUE_HERE: What is broken, missing, or inefficient? 2-3 sentences describing the specific pain point.]

### Purpose
[YOUR_VALUE_HERE: One-sentence outcome statement. What does success look like?]
<!-- /ANCHOR:problem -->

<!-- ANCHOR:measured-behavior -->
### Measured Behavior
<!-- FILL: Run the command this change affects and paste the command and its verbatim output. Quote every number the spec states about current behavior from this block. Write `N/A:` and a reason when no command applies. GOOD: `bash scripts/rotate-logs.sh` with 10 archives, then `ls logs/archive | wc -l` prints 10. WEAK: The script deletes old logs. -->
```text
[YOUR_VALUE_HERE: command and its verbatim output]
```
<!-- /ANCHOR:measured-behavior -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:scope -->
## 3. SCOPE
<!-- FILL: List three to five things this change does, each starting with a verb. GOOD: Add a `--keep <n>` option that deletes all but the newest n archives in `logs/archive/`. WEAK: Update the script and docs. -->

### In Scope
- [YOUR_VALUE_HERE: Deliverable 1]
- [YOUR_VALUE_HERE: Deliverable 2]
- [YOUR_VALUE_HERE: Deliverable 3]

### Out of Scope
- [YOUR_VALUE_HERE: Excluded item 1] - [YOUR_VALUE_HERE: why]
- [YOUR_VALUE_HERE: Excluded item 2] - [YOUR_VALUE_HERE: why]

### Files to Change

| File Path | Change Type | Description |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| [YOUR_VALUE_HERE: path/to/file.js] | [YOUR_VALUE_HERE: Modify/Create/Delete] | [YOUR_VALUE_HERE: Brief description] |
<!-- /ANCHOR:scope -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:requirements -->
## 4. REQUIREMENTS
<!-- FILL: Write one testable requirement per row. Name the exact command or output. GOOD: With 10 archives, `bash scripts/rotate-logs.sh --keep 3` exits 0 and `ls logs/archive | wc -l` prints 3. WEAK: The option should work well. -->
REQ ids run in one sequence across the P0 and P1 tables. A new requirement takes the highest REQ id plus one. validate.sh does not link ids between files.

### P0 - Blockers (MUST complete)

| ID | Requirement |
|----|-------------|
| REQ-001 | [YOUR_VALUE_HERE: Requirement description] |

### P1 - Required (complete OR user-approved deferral)

| ID | Requirement |
|----|-------------|
| REQ-002 | [YOUR_VALUE_HERE: Requirement description] |

> Acceptance criteria for these requirements live in `acceptance-criteria.md`,
> which is the document that decides whether this packet may close.
<!-- /ANCHOR:requirements -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:success-criteria -->
## 5. SUCCESS CRITERIA
<!-- FILL: Write one measurable outcome per line. A command can prove it. GOOD: With 10 archives in `logs/archive`, `bash scripts/rotate-logs.sh --keep 3` leaves 3. WEAK: The feature is successful. -->

- **SC-001**: [YOUR_VALUE_HERE: Primary measurable outcome]
- **SC-002**: [YOUR_VALUE_HERE: Secondary measurable outcome]
<!-- /ANCHOR:success-criteria -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:risks -->
## 6. RISKS & DEPENDENCIES
<!-- FILL: Name one dependency and one risk. Give each a concrete mitigation. GOOD: A script that reads `--keep` with no value could delete every archive. Mitigation: reject a missing value with exit 2 and test it. WEAK: There may be some risk. -->

| Type | Item | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------|--------|------------|
| Dependency | [YOUR_VALUE_HERE: System/API] | [YOUR_VALUE_HERE: What if blocked] | [YOUR_VALUE_HERE: Fallback plan] |
| Risk | [YOUR_VALUE_HERE: Risk description] | [YOUR_VALUE_HERE: High/Med/Low] | [YOUR_VALUE_HERE: Mitigation strategy] |
<!-- /ANCHOR:risks -->

<!-- ANCHOR:nfr -->
## L2: NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
<!-- FILL: Name one measurable limit per line. Write `N/A` and one reason when the packet runs no service, or delete the whole section. GOOD: The option adds under 5 ms to a run. WEAK: Performance is good. -->
<!-- /ANCHOR:nfr -->

### Performance
- **NFR-P01**: [YOUR_VALUE_HERE: Response time target - e.g., <200ms p95]
- **NFR-P02**: [YOUR_VALUE_HERE: Throughput target - e.g., 100 req/sec]

### Security
- **NFR-S01**: [YOUR_VALUE_HERE: Auth requirement - e.g., JWT tokens required]
- **NFR-S02**: [YOUR_VALUE_HERE: Data protection - e.g., TLS + encrypted at rest]

### Reliability
- **NFR-R01**: [YOUR_VALUE_HERE: Uptime target - e.g., 99.9%]
- **NFR-R02**: [YOUR_VALUE_HERE: Error rate - e.g., <1%]

<!-- ANCHOR:edge-cases -->
## L2: EDGE CASES
<!-- FILL: Name the empty input, the maximum input and the failure path. One line each. Write `N/A` with one reason, or delete the whole section. GOOD: Empty input: an empty `logs/archive/` deletes nothing and exits 0. Maximum: `--keep 3` over 10,000 archives keeps the newest 3. Failure path: a missing `--keep` value exits 2 with usage. WEAK: Handle edge cases. -->

- Empty input: [YOUR_VALUE_HERE: How system handles]
- Maximum input: [YOUR_VALUE_HERE: Limit and behavior]
- Failure path: [YOUR_VALUE_HERE: Exit code and message]

<!-- ANCHOR:complexity -->
## L2: COMPLEXITY ASSESSMENT
<!-- FILL: Score each row with the number the change earns. The total must match the level. Write `N/A` with one reason, or delete the whole section. GOOD: Scope 6/25: one option in `scripts/rotate-logs.sh`. Total 18/100. WEAK: Complexity is medium. -->

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Scope | [YOUR_VALUE_HERE: /25] | [YOUR_VALUE_HERE: Files, LOC, systems] |
| Risk | [YOUR_VALUE_HERE: /25] | [YOUR_VALUE_HERE: Auth, API, breaking changes] |
| Research | [YOUR_VALUE_HERE: /20] | [YOUR_VALUE_HERE: Investigation needs] |
| **Total** | **[YOUR_VALUE_HERE: /70]** | **Level 2** |
<!-- /ANCHOR:complexity -->

<!-- ANCHOR:questions -->
## 10. OPEN QUESTIONS
<!-- FILL: Write each open question as one line. Write `None` when nothing blocks. GOOD: Does a missing `--keep` value delete every archive? Decision: no, a missing value exits 2. WEAK: Edge cases are unclear. -->

- [YOUR_VALUE_HERE: Question 1 requiring clarification]
- [YOUR_VALUE_HERE: Question 2 requiring clarification]
