# Feature Specification: Build create-feature-catalog packet

<!-- SPECKIT_LEVEL: 1 -->

## 1. METADATA

| Field | Value |

<!-- ANCHOR:problem -->
## 2. PROBLEM & PURPOSE

### Problem Statement
Phase 008 of the sk-doc monolith to parent-hub conversion. Scaffolded as a placeholder pending the phase 001 deep-research rulings; deliverables and file lists are seeded from the foundation phase decomposition and finalized when this phase is worked.

### Purpose
Build create-feature-catalog: feature_catalog_creation.md + the template pair (feature_catalog_template, feature_catalog_snippet_template), symlinking shared validators (incl its validate_feature_catalog_table branch) inward. Stays separate from playbook unless 001 rules for the create-validation-package merge.
<!-- /ANCHOR:problem -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:scope -->
## 3. SCOPE

### In Scope
- create-feature-catalog/ SKILL.md + README.md + changelog/
- references/feature_catalog_creation.md
- assets/feature_catalog/* + inward symlinks

### Out of Scope
- Work owned by another phase in the parent Phase Documentation Map.
- Rewriting doc-type doctrine content (this program moves content, it does not rewrite standards).

### Files to Change

| File Path | Change Type | Description |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| `.opencode/skills/sk-doc/` | TBD | Enumerated from the 001 deep-research rulings when this phase is worked |
<!-- /ANCHOR:scope -->

<!-- ANCHOR:requirements -->
## 4. REQUIREMENTS

### P0 - Blockers (MUST complete)

| ID | Requirement | Acceptance Criteria |
|----|-------------|---------------------|
| REQ-001 | create-feature-catalog/ SKILL.md + README.md + changelog/ | Deliverable exists and validates; canon invariants preserved |

### P1 - Required (complete OR user-approved deferral)

| ID | Requirement | Acceptance Criteria |
|----|-------------|---------------------|
| REQ-002 | references/feature_catalog_creation.md | Deliverable exists and validates; canon invariants preserved |
| REQ-003 | assets/feature_catalog/* + inward symlinks | Deliverable exists and validates; canon invariants preserved |
<!-- /ANCHOR:requirements -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:success-criteria -->
## 5. SUCCESS CRITERIA

- **SC-001**: Phase deliverables complete with evidence; `validate.sh` passes for this folder.
- **SC-002**: Zero external-coupling breakage introduced by this phase (facades resolve).
<!-- /ANCHOR:success-criteria -->

<!-- ANCHOR:risks -->
## 6. RISKS & DEPENDENCIES

| Type | Item | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------|--------|------------|
| Dependency | Phase 001 deep-research rulings | This phase's scope may shift | Do not start build work before 001 + 002 gates clear |
| Risk | Over-decomposition / canon drift | Medium | Enforce the 124/022 packet test; one graph-metadata.json; symlinks inward |
<!-- /ANCHOR:risks -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:questions -->
## 7. OPEN QUESTIONS

- Bound to the parent `spec.md` §4 and settled by the 001 deep research.
