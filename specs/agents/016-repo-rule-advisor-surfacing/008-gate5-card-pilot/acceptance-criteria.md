# Acceptance Criteria: Gate 5 card pilot

<!-- SPECKIT_TEMPLATE_SOURCE: acceptance-criteria | v2.2 -->
<!-- HVR_REFERENCE: .skilled/skills/sk-doc/sk-create-with-human-voice/references/hvr-rules.md -->

> This document decides whether the packet may close. A packet is closeable when
> every row below is `Met`, `Waived` or `Superseded`. A `Waived` or `Superseded`
> row MUST name an ADR that exists in `decision-record.md`.

## 1. METADATA

**Packet:** agents/016-repo-rule-advisor-surfacing/008-gate5-card-pilot
**Level:** 2
**Status:** Draft
**Date:** 2026-10-04
<!-- /ANCHOR:metadata -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:criteria -->
## 2. CRITERIA

One row per criterion. `AC-ID` is stable once written: supersede a criterion, never renumber it.

| AC-ID | REQ | Given / When / Then | Verification | Status | Waiver |
|-------|-----|---------------------|--------------|--------|--------|
| AC-001 | REQ-001 | Given a rule edited without regenerating its card, When the checker runs, Then check 11 fails naming the card | pytest drift fixture | Unmet | - |
| AC-002 | REQ-002 | Given the first block's start date, When `git log` is read, Then `preregistration.md` was committed earlier | `git log` output | Unmet | - |
| AC-003 | REQ-003 | Given the block reports, When each arm's long replies are counted, Then each meets the pre-registered size | `results/` report | Unmet | - |
| AC-004 | REQ-004 | Given the analysis, When the decision rule is applied, Then the outcome and its numbers are recorded | `results/` and `implementation-summary.md` | Unmet | - |
| AC-005 | REQ-005 | Given the post-003 `AGENTS.md`, When 7,453 bytes are added, Then arm C runs only at or under 32,768 bytes | T002 measurement | Unmet | - |
| AC-006 | REQ-006 | Given the decision, When the tree is inspected, Then no rejected arm's artifact remains | `git status` and file listing | Unmet | - |

### Status values

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `Met` | Verified. The Verification cell names evidence that was actually observed. |
| `Unmet` | Not yet satisfied. Blocks closure. |
| `Waived` | Deliberately not pursued. Requires an ADR in the Waiver cell. |
| `Superseded` | Replaced by a different criterion or decision. Requires an ADR in the Waiver cell. |

### Waiver cell

Write `-` when the row is `Met` or `Unmet`. Write `ADR-NNN` when the row is
`Waived` or `Superseded`, naming a decision record that exists in
`decision-record.md`. A waiver naming an ADR that is not there fails validation:
the point of a waiver is that someone recorded the reasoning, so an unbacked
waiver is treated as an unmet criterion rather than as a pass.

## 3. CLOSURE STATEMENT

**Closeable:** [Yes/No]

[One or two sentences: which criteria carried the packet, and what was consciously
left out. Write this when the packet is closed, not before.]
