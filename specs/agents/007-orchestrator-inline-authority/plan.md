# Implementation Plan: Let the orchestrator make small inline fixes instead of paying a fresh dispatch for a one-line change, and let a direct operator invocation satisfy the leaf caller-gate

## FIX ADDENDUM: AFFECTED SURFACES

Use this section when `research_intent=fix_bug`, when planning from a deep-review FAIL/CONDITIONAL verdict, or when any finding touches security, path handling, env precedence, schema boundaries, persistence, public responses, or shared policy.

| Surface | Current Role | Action | Verification |
|---------|--------------|--------|--------------|
| [producer/helper/policy] | [what owns the behavior] | [update/unchanged/not a consumer] | [grep/test/doc evidence] |
| [consumer/status/docs/tests] | [how it observes the behavior] | [update/unchanged/not a consumer] | [grep/test/doc evidence] |

Required inventories:
- Same-class producers: `rg -n '<field|string|helper|literal|error-pattern>' <module-or-files>`.
- Consumers of changed symbols: `rg -n '<changedSymbol>|<changedConstant>|<changedPublicField>' . --glob '*.ts' --glob '*.js' --glob '*.md'`.
- Matrix axes: list every independent input axis and the required rows before implementation.
- Algorithm invariant: for path/redaction/parser/resolver/security fixes, state the invariant and adversarial cases.

## 4. IMPLEMENTATION PHASES

### Phase 1: Setup
Map every authored copy and its dialect, because the roster checker verifies presence and not content — an edit to one runtime would otherwise pass unnoticed while three others kept the old contract.

### Phase 2: Implementation
Grant write capability in each dialect, replace the prose bound with one that permits small fixes judged by cost and keeps work with design content or its own verification burden delegated, amend the caller gate, and correct the obsolete subagent type and phantom agent name.

### Phase 3: Verification
Confirm each edit reached exactly the copies it should and none it should not, and that no phantom reference survives.

<!-- ANCHOR:testing -->
## 5. TESTING STRATEGY

Agent definitions have no test suite, so verification is a symmetry check: each orchestrate-only edit must appear in exactly the four orchestrate copies and none of the code copies, and the gate amendment the reverse. A partial application shows as an asymmetric pattern rather than passing silently.

The roster checker is run for regression, but it cannot confirm this work: its own comment states that only presence is checked, never content equality.

<!-- /ANCHOR:dependencies -->

<!-- ANCHOR:rollback -->
## 7. ROLLBACK PLAN

Eight tracked files, no generated artifacts. Revert the commit to restore the previous contracts. Reverting returns the orchestrator to paying a full dispatch for a one-line change, which is the cost this packet exists to remove.

## L2: ENHANCED ROLLBACK

### Pre-deployment Checklist
- [ ] Backup created (if data changes)
- [ ] Feature flag configured
- [ ] Monitoring alerts set

### Rollback Procedure
1. [Immediate action - e.g., disable feature flag]
2. [Revert code - e.g., git revert or redeploy previous version]
3. [Verify rollback - e.g., smoke test critical paths]
4. [Notify stakeholders - if user-facing]

### Data Reversal
- **Has data migrations?** [Yes/No]
- **Reversal procedure**: [Steps or "N/A"]
